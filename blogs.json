This design facilitates synchronous data replication and automated zero data loss failover for single and multi-Region Aurora DSQL clusters. In this post, I discuss the individual components and the responsibilities of a multi-Region distributed database to provide an ACID-compliant, strongly consistent relational database."

Amazon Aurora DSQL doesn’t have write-only transactions, since it’s imperative to verify the table schema or ensure the uniqueness of primary keys on each change – which results them being read-write transactions as well."
