When JC Boissy’s serverless card game [CloudJack-21](https://www.cloudjack-21.com/) earned an honorable mention in the [2024 AWS Game Builder Challenge](https://awsdevchallenge.devpost.com/), it marked an incredible milestone in his cloud computing journey. Among 331 submissions from developers worldwide, his educational card game stood out. The achievement was even more remarkable given that JC had minimal hands-on cloud experience before joining [AWS Cloud Institute](https://aws.amazon.com/training/aws-cloud-institute/), a virtual training program that helps learners launch cloud development careers in as little as nine months.

## A career at a crossroads

JC Boissy’s path to cloud development wasn’t a straight line. With years of experience moving from software development to management and then IT project management, he had built a solid career in tech. But when his employer shut down in late 2023, JC found himself at a pivotal moment.

“After a couple of months of job searching, I realized something important,” JC explains. “Getting into senior tech roles today isn’t just about past experience—it’s about who you know and, more importantly, having current, hands-on technical skills.”

The landscape had shifted significantly since his early days as a developer. While he had managed cloud-based projects as a project manager, JC hadn’t worked directly with the technologies themselves. “I missed being in a purely technical role,” he recalls. “But I knew I needed to level up my capabilities to match where technology is today.”

Initially, JC came across AWS Cloud Institute while looking for opportunities for his son. As he reviewed the program details, he had an epiphany—he was actually the one who needed it. “It had been a very long time since I’d taken an exam, and technology had changed so much. I needed to get back to where tech is today.”

## Finding his path with AWS Cloud Institute

“AWS Cloud Institute was a godsend,” JC says. “The program offered exactly what I needed—a structured path to become a cloud developer who could build applications from beginning to end. I decided to go all in, focusing full-time on rebuilding my technical foundation.”

The decision to join AWS Cloud Institute marked a significant commitment. Despite having managed cloud-based projects, JC admits, “Until I joined AWS Cloud Institute, I didn’t have any hands-on experience in the cloud—just general concepts about cloud computing.”

What particularly attracted him to the program was its comprehensive approach. “The program is guided by people who work at the source—actual AWS experts. I couldn’t have gotten this perspective studying on my own. They helped me focus on the big picture while building practical skills.”

JC threw himself into the program’s rigorous curriculum, which, at the time of his enrollment, included twelve courses covering both technical and professional skill development, over 150 hands-on labs, and preparation for two AWS certifications. He began putting his new knowledge to work immediately, starting with small applications.

“I decided to start deploying small applications to build confidence,” JC shares. “My first project was a static website, but I knew I wanted to do more. The program gave me the foundation to tackle increasingly complex projects.”

This foundation would prove crucial when the opportunity to participate in the AWS Game Builder Challenge arose. But more than just technical skills, AWS Cloud Institute provided JC with something equally valuable—the confidence to take on new challenges.

“The cloud is revolutionizing how businesses operate,” JC notes. “By gaining these skills, you’re not just preparing for a job, you’re positioning yourself at the forefront of technological innovation. And the program helped me realize that I could not only learn these new technologies but actually build something meaningful with them,” JC reflects. “It was about transforming from someone who understood cloud concepts to someone who could actually implement cloud solutions.”

## CloudJack-21: Where gaming meets cloud learning

“Initially, I wasn’t sure if I should even enter the AWS Game Builder Challenge,” JC recalls. “But I had this Python script for a blackjack game, and during one of AWS Cloud Institute’s *Level Up* sessions, inspiration struck—I could transform each card into an AWS service, creating an engaging way to teach cloud concepts.”

The resulting game, CloudJack-21, combines classic blackjack mechanics with cloud computing education. Players build virtual cloud infrastructure using AWS service cards, each representing real services with authentic characteristics. The game features two phases:

1. **Infrastructure Building:** Players aim to build cloud architecture with a total value under 21
2. **Cloud Battle:** Players take on either “Cloudjacker” or “Cybersecurity” roles, using challenge or defense cards

“I wanted to create something that was both fun and educational,” JC says. “The challenge was balancing gameplay with accurate representations of AWS services.”

## Leveraging AI to build a serverless success

To create CloudJack-21, JC leveraged a full stack of AWS services, including [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/), and [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/). As part of the AWS Game Builder Challenge requirements, JC also utilized AI tools like [Amazon Q Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/) and [PartyRock](https://partyrock.aws/). “These tools were like having a virtual team member,” JC explains. “They helped with everything from code suggestions to content generation, which was crucial given the tight development timeline.”

But the development process wasn’t without its challenges. “Time constraints were a big factor,” JC admits. “I was working against the submission deadline, which pushed me to prioritize effectively and make the most of the AI tools available to us as part of the challenge.”

JC also highlights the learning curve involved: “I was simultaneously learning new programming languages and AWS services while building the game. It was intense but incredibly rewarding.”

“Being recognized among hundreds of submissions was incredible,” JC says. “When I saw the other winning games, it made me even prouder—these developers created some really advanced projects, and to be mentioned alongside them validated how far I’d come.”

## The AWS Cloud Institute difference

JC attributes his rapid transformation from cloud novice to award-winning game developer to AWS Cloud Institute’s comprehensive training program. “Before AWS Cloud Institute, I managed cloud-based projects but didn’t have hands-on experience. The program changed everything.”

The structured curriculum provided:

* Expert-led instruction from AWS professionals
* 150+ hands-on labs for practical experience
* Comprehensive coverage of AWS services
* Real-world project opportunities
* A supportive learning community

“The program guided me through everything I needed to build CloudJack-21—from basic cloud concepts to advanced serverless architecture. I couldn’t have done it studying alone.”

JC particularly appreciated the program’s focus on practical application. “Every concept we learned, we immediately put into practice through labs and projects. This hands-on approach was crucial in building my confidence and skills.”

## The power of community

One aspect of AWS Cloud Institute that JC found particularly valuable was the sense of community. “Having a Slack channel available 24/7 and regular office hours with AWS instructors made a huge difference,” he says. “Whenever I hit a roadblock, there was always someone willing to help or offer a new perspective.”

The program’s *Fun Fridays* also stood out to JC. “These sessions focused on new topics and career advice, which kept us engaged and thinking creatively about how to apply our skills.”

## Looking to the future

Fresh from his AWS Game Builder Challenge success, JC is now pursuing additional AWS Certifications while seeking roles in cloud development and architecture. He’s already earned his [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1), [AWS Certified AI Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-ai-practitioner/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1), and [AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1) certifications, with [AWS Certified Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1) certification in his immediate plans.

“My goal is to land a job in AWS Cloud development or architecture,” JC shares. “I want to be part of a team building innovative cloud applications that make a real impact.”

For those inspired by his story, JC emphasizes the importance of structured learning: “AWS Cloud Institute provides the foundation you need to build real-world cloud applications. They don’t just teach you the technology—they show you how to use it creatively and effectively.”

“This journey has shown me that with the right training and determination, you can go from understanding cloud concepts to building award-winning applications in less than a year,” JC reflects. “CloudJack-21 is just the beginning.”

## Advice for aspiring cloud developers

JC offers some words of encouragement for others considering a similar path: “Don’t be intimidated by the complexity of cloud technologies. With a structured program like AWS Cloud Institute, you can break it down into manageable steps and build your skills progressively.”

He also stresses the importance of hands-on practice: “Theory is important, but nothing beats actually building things. Start small, experiment, and don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s how you learn and grow.”
