by Shoeb Bustani, Brijesh Pati, and Rohan Ghosh on 04 MAR 2025 in [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/artificial-intelligence/amazon-machine-learning/amazon-bedrock/ "View all posts in Amazon Bedrock"), [Artificial Intelligence](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/artificial-intelligence/ "View all posts in Artificial Intelligence"), [AWS Well-Architected](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/aws-well-architected/ "View all posts in AWS Well-Architected"), [Generative AI](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai/ "View all posts in Generative AI") [Permalink](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/accelerate-aws-well-architected-reviews-with-generative-ai/)  [Comments](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/accelerate-aws-well-architected-reviews-with-generative-ai/#Comments)  Share

Building cloud infrastructure based on proven best practices promotes security, reliability and cost efficiency. To achieve these goals, the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) provides comprehensive guidance for building and improving cloud architectures. As systems scale, conducting thorough AWS Well-Architected Framework Reviews (WAFRs) becomes even more crucial, offering deeper insights and strategic value to help organizations optimize their growing cloud environments.

In this post, we explore a generative AI solution leveraging Amazon Bedrock to streamline the WAFR process. We demonstrate how to harness the power of LLMs to build an intelligent, scalable system that analyzes architecture documents and generates insightful recommendations based on AWS Well-Architected best practices. This solution automates portions of the WAFR report creation, helping solutions architects improve the efficiency and thoroughness of architectural assessments while supporting their decision-making process.

## Scaling Well-Architected reviews using a generative AI-powered solution

As organizations expand their cloud footprint, they face several challenges in adhering to the Well-Architected Framework:

* Time-consuming and resource-intensive manual reviews
* Inconsistent application of Well-Architected principles across different teams
* Difficulty in keeping pace with the latest best practices
* Challenges in scaling reviews for large or numerous architectures

To address these challenges, we have built a [WAFR Accelerator solution](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-well-architected-acceleration-with-generative-ai) that uses generative AI to help streamline and expedite the WAFR process. By automating the initial assessment and documentation process, this solution significantly reduces time spent on evaluations while providing consistent architecture assessments against AWS Well-Architected principles. This allows teams to focus more on implementing improvements and optimizing AWS infrastructure. The solution incorporates the following key features:

* Using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, the system generates a context-aware detailed assessment. The assessment includes a solution summary, an evaluation against Well-Architected pillars, an analysis of adherence to best practices, actionable improvement recommendations, and a risk assessment.
* An interactive chat interface allows deeper exploration of both the original document and generated content.
* Integration with the AWS Well-Architected Tool pre-populates workload information and initial assessment responses.

This solution offers the following key benefits:

* **Rapid analysis and resource optimization** – What previously took days of manual review can now be accomplished in minutes, allowing for faster iteration and improvement of architectures. This time efficiency translates to significant cost savings and optimized resource allocation in the review process.
* **Consistency and enhanced accuracy** – The approach provides a consistent application of AWS Well-Architected principles across reviews, reducing human bias and oversight. This systematic approach leads to more reliable and standardized evaluations.
* **Depth of insight** – Advanced analysis can identify subtle patterns and potential issues that might be missed in manual reviews, providing deeper insights into architectural strengths and weaknesses.
* **Scalability** – The solution can handle multiple reviews simultaneously, making it suitable for organizations of all sizes, from startups to enterprises. This scalability allows for more frequent and comprehensive reviews.
* **Interactive exploration** -The generative AI-driven chat interface allows users to dive deeper into the assessment, asking follow-up questions and gaining a better understanding of the recommendations. This interactivity enhances engagement and promotes more thorough comprehension of the results.

## Solution overview

The [WAFR Accelerator](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-well-architected-acceleration-with-generative-ai) is designed to streamline and enhance the architecture review process by using the capabilities of generative AI through Amazon Bedrock and other AWS services. This solution automates the analysis of complex architecture documents, evaluating them against the AWS Well-Architected Framework’s pillars and providing detailed assessments and recommendations.

The solution consists of the following capabilties:

* **Generative AI-powered analysis** – Uses Amazon Bedrock to rapidly analyze architecture documents against AWS Well-Architected best practices, generating detailed assessments and recommendations.
* **Knowledge base integration** – Incorporates up-to-date WAFR documentation and cloud best practices using [Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/), providing accurate and context-aware evaluations.
* **Customizable** – Uses [prompt engineering](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/prompt-engineering/), which enables customization and iterative refinement of the prompts used to drive the large language model (LLM), allowing for refining and continuous enhancement of the assessment process.
* **Integration with the AWS Well-Architected Tool** – Creates a Well-Architected workload milestone for the assessment and prepopulates answers for WAFR questions based on generative AI-based assessment.
* **Generative AI-assisted chat** – Offers an AI-driven chat interface for in-depth exploration of assessment results, supporting multi-turn conversations with context management.
* **Scalable architecture** – Uses AWS services like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) for efficient processing of multiple reviews.
* **Data privacy and network security** – With Amazon Bedrock, you are in control of your data, and all your inputs and customizations remain private to your AWS account. Your data, such as prompts, completions, custom models, and data used for fine-tuning or continued pre-training, is not used for service improvement and is never shared with third-party model providers. Your data remains in the AWS Region where the API call is processed. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. You can use [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) to create a private connection between your VPC and Amazon Bedrock.

A human-in-the-loop review is still crucial to validate the generative AI findings, checking for accuracy and alignment with organizational requirements.

The following diagram illustrates the solution’s technical architecture.

![solution-architecture](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/02/15/brijespm-architecture.png)

The workflow consists of the following steps:

1. WAFR guidance documents are uploaded to a bucket in [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). These documents form the foundation of the RAG architecture. Using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base, the sample solution ingests these documents and generates embeddings, which are then stored and indexed in [Amazon OpenSearch Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/features/serverless/). This creates a vector database that enables retrieval of relevant WAFR guidance during the review process
2. Users access the WAFR Accelerator Streamlit application through [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/), which provides secure and scalable content delivery. User authentication is handled by [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), making sure only authenticated user have access.
3. Users upload their solution architecture document in PDF format using the Streamlit application running on an [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance that stores it in an S3 bucket. On submission, the WAFR review process is invoked by [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), which queues the review request.
4. The WAFR reviewer, based on Lambda and [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/), is activated by Amazon SQS. It orchestrates the review process, including document content extraction, prompt generation, solution summary, knowledge embedding retrieval, and generation.
5. [Amazon Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/) extracts the content from the uploaded documents, making it machine-readable for further processing.
6. The WAFR reviewer uses [Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/)’ fully managed RAG workflow to query the vector database in OpenSearch Serverless, retrieving relevant WAFR guidance based on the selected WAFR pillar and questions. Metadata filtering is used to improve retrieval accuracy.
7. Using the extracted document content and retrieved embeddings, the WAFR reviewer generates an assessment using [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/). A workload is created in the AWS Well-Architected Tool with answers populated with the assessment results. This allows users to download initial version of the AWS Well-Architected report from the AWS Well-Architected Tool console on completion of the assessment.
8. The assessment is also stored in an [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) table for quick retrieval and future reference.
9. The WAFR Accelerator application retrieves the review status from the DynamoDB table to keep the user informed.
10. Users can chat with the content using Amazon Bedrock, allowing for deeper exploration of the document, assessment, and recommendations.
11. Once the assessment is complete, human reviewers can review it in the AWS Well-Architected Tool.

## Test the solution

The following diagram illustrates the workflow for using the application.

![workflow](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/02/27/worklfow.png)

To demonstrate how generative AI can accelerate AWS Well-Architected reviews, we have developed a Streamlit-based demo web application that serves as the front-end interface for initiating and managing the WAFR review process.

Complete the following steps to test the demo application:

1. Open a new browser window and enter the CloudFront URL provided during the setup.
2. [Add a new user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/how-to-create-user-accounts.html#creating-a-new-user-using-the-console) to the Amazon Cognito user pool deployed by the AWS CDK during the setup. Log in to the application using this user’s credentials.![](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/02/27/loginpage.png)
3. Choose New WAFR Review in the navigation pane.![](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/02/27/home.png)
4. For Analysis type, choose the analysis type:
   * **Quick** – You can generate a quick analysis without creating a workload in the AWS Well-Architected Tool. This option is faster because it groups the questions for an individual pillar into a single prompt. It’s suitable for an initial assessment.
   * **Deep with Well-Architected Tool** – You can generate a comprehensive and detailed analysis that automatically creates a workload in the AWS Well-Architected tool. This thorough review process requires more time to complete as it evaluates each question individually rather than grouping them together. The deep review typically takes approximately 20 minutes, though the actual duration may vary depending on the document size and the number of Well- Architected pillars selected for evaluation.
5. Enter the analysis name and description.

   ![](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/02/27/createnew.png)

![](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/02/17/genai-chat.png)

### Improving assessment quality

The solution uses prompt engineering to optimize textual input to the foundation model (FM) to obtain desired assessment responses. The quality of prompt (the system prompt, in this case) has significant impact on the model output. The solution provides a sample system prompt that is used to drive the assessment. You could enhance this prompt further to align with specific organizational needs. This becomes more crucial when defining and ingesting your own custom lenses.

Another important factor is the quality of the document that is uploaded for assessment. Detailed and architecture-rich documents can result in better inferences and therefore finer assessments. Prompts are defined in such a way that if there is inadequate information for assessment, then it’s highlighted in the output. This minimizes hallucination by the FM and provides a potential opportunity to enrich your design templates in alignment with AWS Well-Architected content.

You could further enhance this solution by using [Amazon Bedrock Guardrails](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/guardrails/) to further reduce hallucinations and ground responses in your own source information.

At the time of writing of this blog, only the AWS Well-Architected Framework, Financial Services Industry, and Analytics lenses have been provisioned. However, other lenses, including custom lenses, could be added with a few refinements to the UI application and underlying data store.

## Clean up

After you’ve finished exploring or using the solution and no longer require these resources, be sure to clean them up to avoid ongoing charges. Follow these steps to remove all associated resources:

1. Navigate to the directory containing your AWS CDK code.
2. Run the following command: `cdk destroy`.
3. Confirm the deletion when prompted.
4. Manually check for and delete any resources that might not have been automatically removed, such as S3 buckets with content or custom IAM roles.
5. Verify that all related resources have been successfully deleted.

## Conclusion

In this post, we showed how generative AI and Amazon Bedrock can play a crucial role in expediting and scaling the AWS Well-Architected Framework reviews within an organization. By automating document analysis and using a WAFR-aware knowledge base, the solution offers rapid and in-depth assessments, helping organizations build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for a variety of applications and workloads.
