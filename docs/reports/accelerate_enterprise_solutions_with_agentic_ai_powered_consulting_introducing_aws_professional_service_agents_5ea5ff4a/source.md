AWS Professional Services set out to help organizations accelerate their cloud adoption with expert guidance and proven methodologies. Today, we’re at a pivotal moment in consulting. Just as cloud computing transformed how enterprises build technology, agentic AI is transforming how consulting services deliver value. We believe in a future where intelligent agents work alongside expert consultants to compress development timelines, elevate solution quality, and enable organizations to achieve their digital transformation goals faster. Making this vision real requires a fundamental reimagining of the traditional consulting model. Drawing on our experience delivering enterprise solutions at scale, I’m excited to announce AWS Professional Services now offers specialized AI agents including the [AWS Professional Services Delivery Agent](https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services/). This represents a transformation to the consulting experience that embeds intelligent agents throughout the consulting life cycle to deliver better value for customers.

## An agent-first consulting approach

The AWS Professional Services (AWS ProServe) new approach to agentic AI fundamentally changes what’s possible with consulting. By combining our deep expertise with specialized AI agents, we’re delivering enterprise solutions faster while maintaining the rigorous quality and security standards our customers expect. Agents empower our consultants to focus on what matters most—understanding their customer’s unique business challenges, providing strategic guidance, and driving meaningful outcomes, while agents handle implementation details with consistency and speed.

We have already started transforming customer engagements through agents, demonstrating tangible impact across industries. Whether you’re building next-generation AI applications, migrating critical workloads to the cloud, or modernizing existing systems, these agents compress timelines from months to weeks—or weeks to days—without compromising on quality.

## A comprehensive agent system across the consulting cycle

Traditional consulting models struggle to balance speed, quality, and cost. A system of specialized agents embodying AWS institutional knowledge and proven methodologies help to solve this challenge.

**AI agents that accelerate every stage**: At the heart of the agent system is the AWS Professional Services Delivery Agent, an AI-powered technical expert that serves as your primary interface for technical engagements. The Delivery Agent analyzes your requirements, builds AI applications directly, and orchestrates specialized work by delegating migration and modernization tasks to purpose-built agents such as the custom agent built on [AWS Transform](https://aws.amazon.com/transform/), an AWS agentic AI service for enterprise migration and modernization workloads. Before delivery even begins, a sales agent streamlines proposal generation and statement of work creation, compressing what traditionally takes weeks into hours. Throughout every engagement, embedded capabilities ensure solutions meet enterprise-grade security and compliance standards.

**From requirements to deployment in record time**: Consider a typical generative AI application development project. Traditionally, building a customer service agent to help representatives quickly access policy information requires 6-8 weeks with a full consulting team gathering requirements, designing architecture, developing code, and deploying the solution. The Delivery Agent ingests your requirements—whether detailed documentation, architecture diagrams, or even meeting notes—and within hours produces comprehensive design specifications and implementation plans aligned with AWS best practices. The agent then generates code, automates testing, and prepares deployment packages while your AWS ProServe consultant provides strategic oversight and ensures alignment with your business context.

**Migration and modernization at scale**: For migration projects, incorporating agents demonstrates even more dramatic acceleration. Imagine a healthcare provider migrating 500+ applications to AWS—traditionally a 12+ month undertaking requiring extensive discovery and planning. We launched AWS Transform in May to help customers accelerate their cloud transformation journeys. Building on AWS Transform and leveraging its composable capability, we have built a custom agent tailored to how AWS ProServe delivers projects. This agent incorporates a knowledge base of learnings from thousands of migrations AWS ProServe has completed and automation capabilities to accelerate project delivery. The Delivery Agent analyzes the statement of work and project artifacts and engages the custom agent for migration, which handles wave planning, dependency mapping, workload scheduling, and runbook generation automatically. Your AWS ProServe consultant maintains strategic oversight while agents compress the timeline to just a few months, all while maintaining rigorous security and compliance standards.

**Built on enterprise-grade AI infrastructure:** The agent system leverages the same technologies we offer customers, including [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/), AWS Transform, and advanced development tools like [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/) and [Amazon Q Developer CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/). This helps ensure that every engagement benefits from industry-leading security through isolated computing environments, comprehensive observability for full transparency, and the scalability to handle engagements of any size.

## Human expertise meets AI acceleration

What truly differentiates AWS ProServe agents is how it combines the value of human expertise with the speed and consistency of AI agents. AWS ProServe consultants remain integral to every engagement including understanding your business context, providing strategic guidance, making critical decisions, and building lasting relationships. The agents amplify their impact by handling implementation details, code generation, testing, and deployment with proven AWS methodologies embedded directly into their operations.

This human-AI collaboration delivers customer value through:

1. **Unprecedented speed**: Reduce project timelines achieving in days what traditionally required months
2. **Consistent excellence**: Every solution incorporates AWS best practices, architectural patterns, and the Well-Architected Framework
3. **Lower total costs**: Streamlined delivery and accelerated time-to-value translate directly to better ROI

Unlike general-purpose AI tools, the agents embody AWS specialized knowledge, including decades of experience informed by thousands of prior engagements, and proven methodologies. It draws from the vast AWS institutional knowledge base and has been specifically designed for enterprise-grade solution delivery. Further backed by AWS ProServe’s consulting expertise to ensure every solution meets your unique business requirements.

## Making business transformation real with agents

Organizations across industries are already experiencing results by partnering with AWS ProServe agents, from rapid AI application development to accelerated cloud migrations. The National Football League (NFL) faced a challenge familiar to many organizations, building agents to serve millions of fantasy football fans while maintaining both speed and reliability. Working with the AWS Professional Services team, they used the delivery agent and were able to deploy a production quality prototype that seamlessly integrate NextGen Stats, Player News, weather data, and both proprietary and public NFL information to generate personalized fantasy football recommendation in just a few days.

“Building an AI agent that serves thousands of fantasy football fans requires both speed and reliability. The AWS Professional Services Delivery Agent helped us achieve both – we went from zero to production in 8 weeks while maintaining the quality standards NFL fans expect. The framework automated routine development tasks, freeing our team to focus on performance optimization and delivering unique insights powered by NFL’s proprietary data,” says Mike Band, Senior Manager, Research & Analytics, Next Gen Stats, NFL.

The transformation extends beyond customer outcomes to how AWS ProServe delivers consulting services. “Our goal with AWS Transform has always been to enable better customer outcomes through transformative new approaches to migration,” says Asa Kalavade, Vice President of AWS Transform. “AWS Professional Services’ custom agent, built on AWS Transform’s composable foundation, demonstrates this vision perfectly. It delivers customized workflows tailored to how AWS ProServe works directly in customer accounts, with goal-based, interactive agents that personalize each migration. Whether orchestrating large VMware migrations or handling dynamic wave planning for enterprises migrating thousands of VMs, these agents adapt to each customer’s unique context. This is the future of migration—faster, more personalized, and delivering outcomes that traditional approaches simply couldn’t achieve.”

This represents the future of professional services: AI-augmented consulting that delivers results without sacrificing the strategic guidance and partnership that complex enterprise initiatives require.

## Reimagining the future of consulting with agentic AI

This new agentic-powered consulting approach is a demonstration of what becomes possible when you apply cutting-edge AI technologies to transform your own operations. While many organizations talk about what AI might do someday, AWS ProServe shows what AI can deliver for enterprises today. Customers can experience the new agent-powered consulting model by engaging with AWS ProServe and AWS Professional Services Partners today.
