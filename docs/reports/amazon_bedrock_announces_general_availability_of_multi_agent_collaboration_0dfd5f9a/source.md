Today, we’re announcing the general availability (GA) of [multi-agent collaboration](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/) on [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/). This capability allows developers to build, deploy, and manage networks of AI agents that work together to execute complex, multi-step workflows efficiently.

Since its preview launch at re:Invent 2024, organizations across industries—including financial services, healthcare, supply chain and logistics, manufacturing, and customer support—have used multi-agent collaboration to orchestrate specialized agents, driving efficiency, accuracy, and automation. With this GA release, we’ve introduced enhancements based on customer feedback, further improving scalability, observability, and flexibility—making AI-driven workflows easier to manage and optimize.

## What is multi-agent collaboration?

Generative AI is no longer just about models generating responses, it’s about automation. The next wave of innovation is driven by agents that can reason, plan, and act autonomously across company systems. Generative AI applications are no longer just generating content; they also take action, solve problems, and execute complex workflows. The shift is clear: businesses need AI that doesn’t just respond to prompts but orchestrates entire workflows, automating processes end to end.

Agents enable generative AI applications to perform tasks across company systems and data sources, and Amazon Bedrock already simplifies building them. With Amazon Bedrock, customers can quickly create agents that handle sales orders, compile financial reports, analyze customer retention, and much more. However, as applications become more capable, the tasks customers want them to perform can exceed what a single agent can manage—either because the tasks require specialized expertise, involve multiple steps, or demand continuous execution over time.

Coordinating potentially hundreds of agents at scale is also challenging, because managing dependencies, ensuring efficient task distribution, and maintaining performance across a large network of specialized agents requires sophisticated orchestration. Without the right tools, businesses can face inefficiencies, increased latency, and difficulties in monitoring and optimizing performance. For customers looking to advance their agents and tackle more intricate, multi-step workflows, Amazon Bedrock supports multi-agent collaboration, enabling developers to easily build, deploy, and manage multiple specialized agents working together seamlessly.

[Multi-agent collaboration](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/) enables developers to create networks of specialized agents that communicate and coordinate under the guidance of a supervisor agent. Each agent contributes its expertise to the larger workflow by focusing on a specific task. This approach breaks down complex processes into manageable sub-tasks processed in parallel. By facilitating seamless interaction among agents, [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) enhances operational efficiency and accuracy, ensuring workflows run more effectively at scale. Because each agent only accesses the data required for its role, this approach minimizes exposure of sensitive information while reinforcing security and governance. This allows businesses to scale their AI-driven workflows without the need for manual intervention in coordinating agents. As more agents are added, the supervisor ensures smooth collaboration between them all.

By using multi-agent collaboration on Amazon Bedrock, organizations can:

* Streamline AI-driven workflows by distributing workloads across specialized agents.
* Improve execution efficiency by parallelizing tasks where possible.
* Enhance security and governance by restricting agent access to only necessary data.
* Reduce operational complexity by eliminating manual intervention in agent coordination.

A key challenge in building eﬀective [multi-agent collaboration](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/) systems is managing the complexity and overhead of coordinating multiple specialized agents at scale. [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) simplifies the process of building, deploying, and orchestrating effective multi-agent collaboration systems while addressing efficiency challenges through several key features and optimizations:

* **Quick setup** – Create, deploy, and manage AI agents working together in minutes without the need for complex coding.
* **Composability** – Integrate your existing agents as subagents within a larger agent system, allowing them to seamlessly work together to tackle complex workflows.
* **Efficient inter-agent communication** – The supervisor agent can interact with subagents using a consistent interface, supporting parallel communication for more efficient task completion.
* **Optimized collaboration modes** – Choose between supervisor mode and supervisor with routing mode. With routing mode, the supervisor agent will route simple requests directly to specialized subagents, bypassing full orchestration. For complex queries or when no clear intention is detected, it automatically falls back to the full supervisor mode, where the supervisor agent analyzes, breaks down problems, and coordinates multiple subagents as needed.
* **Integrated trace and debug console** – Visualize and analyze multi-agent interactions behind the scenes using the integrated trace and debug console.

## What’s new in general availability?

The GA release introduces several key enhancements based on customer feedback, making multi-agent collaboration more scalable, flexible, and efficient:

* **Inline agent support** – Enables the creation of supervisor agents dynamically at runtime, allowing for more flexible agent management without predefined structures.
* [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) **and** [AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk) **support** – Enables customers to deploy agent networks as code, enabling scalable, reusable agent templates across AWS accounts.
* **Enhanced traceability and debugging** – Provides structured execution logs, sub-step tracking, and [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch) integration to improve monitoring and troubleshooting.
* **Increased collaborator and step count limits** – Expands self-service limits for agent collaborators and execution steps, supporting larger-scale workflows.
* **Payload referencing** – Reduces latency and costs by allowing the supervisor agent to reference external data sources without embedding them in the agent request.
* **Improved citation handling** – Enhances accuracy and attribution when agents pull external data sources into their responses.

These features collectively improve coordination capabilities, communication speed, and overall effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration framework in tackling complex, real-world problems.

## Multi-agent collaboration across industries

Multi-agent collaboration is already transforming AI automation across sectors:

* **Investment advisory** – A financial firm uses multiple agents to analyze market trends, risk factors, and investment opportunities to deliver personalized client recommendations.
* **Retail operations** – A retailer deploys agents for demand forecasting, inventory tracking, pricing optimization, and order fulfillment to increase operational efficiency.
* **Fraud detection** – A banking institution assigns agents to monitor transactions, detect anomalies, validate customer behaviors, and flag potential fraud risks in real time.
* **Customer support** – An enterprise customer service platform uses agents for sentiment analysis, ticket classification, knowledge base retrieval, and automated responses to enhance resolution times.
* **Healthcare diagnosis** – A hospital system integrates agents for patient record analysis, symptom recognition, medical imaging review, and treatment plan recommendations to assist clinicians.
