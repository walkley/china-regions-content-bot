Since its [launch in 2023](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-amazon-bedrock-general-availability-generative-ai-innovations), organizations have embraced Amazon Bedrock’s multi-model approach, leveraging diverse foundation models (FMs) from multiple providers to address unique business challenges and create transformative AI applications and agents securely and at scale.

Today, we’re excited to announce that Amazon Bedrock joins our Authorized Services List and is now available for resale by our AWS Channel Partners. Partners in the [AWS Solution Provider](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/programs/solution-provider/) and [AWS Distribution](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/programs/distribution-resellers/) programs can expand their AI portfolio by reselling Amazon Bedrock, which includes models from industry-leading providers: AI21, Anthropic\*, Cohere, DeepSeek, Luma AI, Meta, Mistral, OpenAI, Stability AI, TwelveLabs, and Amazon ([Nova](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/?trk=978e13b6-fa37-4872-9001-1825f3ca3367&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=Cj0KCQjw3aLHBhDTARIsAIRij59zLUqvKy86iCb_5XER9ijY6R4_xshaI_AG6Deni4sIqPCBkojLqi4aAuWxEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!692006004844!e!!g!!amazon%20nova!21048268689!159639953895&gad_campaignid=21048268689&gbraid=0AAAAADjHtp9VLM4pZ1y8YaMdvfKCe4fv_&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3aLHBhDTARIsAIRij59zLUqvKy86iCb_5XER9ijY6R4_xshaI_AG6Deni4sIqPCBkojLqi4aAuWxEALw_wcB) and [Amazon Titan](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/amazon-models/titan/)).

## Empowering Partners with secure AI solutions
