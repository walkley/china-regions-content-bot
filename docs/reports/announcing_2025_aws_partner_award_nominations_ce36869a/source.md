*By Andrew Somera, Head of AWS To-Partner Marketing*

The 2025 AWS Partner Awards honor partners who have demonstrated outstanding results and innovation with the use of Amazon Web Services (AWS) products and solutions. These awards are an acknowledgment of exceptional partner success and innovations.

AWS Partner Awards recognizes a wide range of born-in-the-cloud and traditional services, software, and hardware partners whose business models have embraced specialization and collaboration.

## Nomination-Based Award Categories

For the fourth year in a row, AWS Partners can self-nominate themselves to be considered across a select number of AWS Partner Award categories, related to partner focus areas, technologies, and the significant impact partners are making in delighting our customers.

Award submissions will be reviewed by a third-party, Canalys, and selected with special emphasis placed on customer success use cases presented in the nomination form. All winners will be informed by October 31, 2025, and will be recognized and celebrated at this year’s AWS re:Invent.

**All nominations must be submitted by 11:59 PM PDT on August 15, 2025.**

## Nomination Categories and Forms

AWS Partners can apply to more than one award, but they may not submit multiple nominations per any given category. A list of the five categories accepting nominations with specific eligibility requirements and details is featured below. A separate application is required for each category.
