Customers across industries are harnessing the power of [generative AI on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el) to boost employee productivity, deliver exceptional customer experiences, and streamline business processes. However, the growth in demand for GPU capacity has outpaced industry-wide supply, making GPUs a scarce resource and increasing the cost of securing them.

As [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el) grows, we work hard to lower our costs so that we can pass those savings back to our customers. Regular [price reductions on AWS services](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/category/price-reduction/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el) have been a standard way for AWS to pass on the economic efficiencies gained from our scale back to our customers.

Today, we’re announcing up to 45 percent price reduction for [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el) NVIDIA GPU-accelerated instances: [P4](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p4/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el) (P4d and P4de) and [P5](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p5/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el) (P5 and P5en) instance types. This price reduction to [On-Demand](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el) and [Savings Plan](https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el) pricing applies to all Regions where these instances are available. The pricing reduction applies to On-Demand purchases beginning June 1 and to Savings Plan purchases effective after June 4.

Here is a table of price reductions percentage (%) from May 31, 2025 baseline prices by instance types and pricing plans:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Instance type** | **NVIDIA** **GPUs** | **On-Demand** | **EC2 Instance Savings Plans** | | **Compute Savings Plans** | |
| 1 year | 3 years | 1 year | 3 years |
| P4d | A100 | 33% | 31% | 25% | 31% | – |
| P4de | A100 | 33% | 31% | 25% | 31% | – |
| P5 | H100 | 44% | – | 45% | 44% | 25% |
| P5en | H200 | 25% | – | 26% | 25% | – |

Savings Plans are a flexible pricing model that offer low prices on compute usage, in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1- or 3- year term. We offers two types of Savings Plans:

* [EC2 Instance Savings Plans](https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/compute-pricing/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el) provide the lowest prices, offering savings in exchange for commitment to usage of individual instance families in a Region (for example, P5 usage in the US (N. Virginia) Region).
* [Compute Savings Plans](https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/compute-pricing/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el) provide the most flexibility and help to reduce your costs regardless of instance family, size, Availability Zones, and Regions (for example, from P4d to P5en instances, shift a workload between US Regions).

To provide increased accessibility to reduced pricing, we are making at-scale On-Demand capacity available for:

* P4d instances in the Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Canada (Central), and Europe (London) Regions
* P4de instances in the US East (N. Virginia) Region
* P5 instances in the Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Jakarta), and South America (São Paulo) Regions
* P5en instances in the Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), and Asia Pacific (Jakarta) Regions

We are also now delivering [Amazon EC2 P6-B200 instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p6/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el) through Savings Plan to support large scale deployments, which [became available](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-p6-b200-instances-powered-by-nvidia-blackwell-gpus-to-accelerate-ai-innovations/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el) on May 15, 2025 at launch only through [EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/capacityblocks/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el). EC2 P6-B200 instances, powered by NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, accelerate a broad range of GPU-enabled workloads but are especially well-suited for large-scale distributed AI training and inferencing.

These pricing updates reflect the AWS commitment to making advanced GPU computing more accessible while passing cost savings directly to customers.
