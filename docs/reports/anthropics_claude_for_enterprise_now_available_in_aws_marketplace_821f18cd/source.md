# Anthropic’s Claude for Enterprise is now available in AWS Marketplace

by Brian Terry, Ikenna Izugbokwe, and Gabriel Velazquez Lopez on 15 JUL 2025 in [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsmarketplace/category/artificial-intelligence/amazon-machine-learning/amazon-bedrock/ "View all posts in Amazon Bedrock"), [Announcements](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsmarketplace/category/post-types/announcements/ "View all posts in Announcements"), [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsmarketplace/category/software/aws-marketplace/ "View all posts in AWS Marketplace"), [AWS Partner Network](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsmarketplace/category/aws-partner-network/ "View all posts in AWS Partner Network"), [Generative AI](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsmarketplace/category/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai/ "View all posts in Generative AI") [Permalink](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsmarketplace/anthropics-claude-for-enterprise-now-available-in-aws-marketplace/) Share

*October 27, 2025 updates to this blog include adding a fourth solution, Claude for Life Sciences, to the list of solutions for different needs.*

Today marks a milestone in making AI accessible to enterprises worldwide. Anthropic’s [Claude for Enterprise](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-nnvi6wff6ef6m) is now available in [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/), combining Anthropic’s advanced AI collaborator with the streamlined procurement and billing benefits of [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/).

Enterprise teams face a familiar challenge: data is everywhere, but insights remain elusive. Analysts spend hours sifting through hundreds of sales transcripts, engineers manually debug complex codebases, and decision-makers struggle to access organizational knowledge buried in documents, emails, and repositories. Many AI solutions require building custom integrations or lack the context and integrations to handle enterprise-scale data effectively.

## Introducing Anthropic’s Claude for Enterprise in AWS Marketplace

[Anthropic](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=seller-nlf3zg73sn7by) has built Claude, one of the most capable [large language models (LLMs)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/large-language-model/) available today. But Claude for Enterprise isn’t just access to Anthropic’s Claude model—it’s Anthropic’s vision of how AI should work within organizations.

This is a critical distinction: although Anthropic’s Claude models are available through [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) for developers building and scaling [generative AI](https://aws.amazon.com/generative-ai/) applications, Claude for Enterprise is a fully featured [software-as-a-service](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/saas/) solution. It’s the same tool that Anthropic’s own employees use daily to increase their productivity, packaged for enterprise deployment, and now available in AWS Marketplace.

## Four solutions for different needs

AWS Marketplace now offers four specialized Claude solutions:

* [**Claude for Enterprise**](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-nnvi6wff6ef6m) – Ready-to-use AI collaborator for every employee ($40 per user per month, 25 seat minimum)
* **The Financial Analysis Solution** – Tailored version of Claude for Enterprise specifically built for financial analysts with pre-built financial data source integrations (available through private offers)
* **Claude for Education** – Educational version of Claude featuring [Learning Mode](https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-claude-for-education) that uses Socratic questioning to guide students toward answers rather than providing direct responses
* **Claude for Life Sciences**  – Tailored version of Claude for Enterprise specifically built for Life Sciences use cases with pre-built data sources and MCP server integrations (through private offers)

## Build or buy: Understanding your options

If you want to build AI applications using Anthropic’s Claude models, Amazon Bedrock provides API access with the flexibility to integrate Anthropic’s Claude into custom solutions. Claude for Enterprise, available in AWS Marketplace, is the “buy” solution—a complete AI collaboration resource that requires no development work. It includes projects (shown in the following screenshot) for team collaboration, native integrations with GitHub and Google Workspace, enterprise security controls, and a UI that makes AI accessible to every team member, not only developers.

Anthropic’s Claude for Enterprise in AWS Marketplace offers several capabilities scaled for enterprise, including large context windows, enterprise-grade security and compliance, native integrations, and both pre-built and custom integrations through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol).

### Large context window for enterprise scale

Claude for Enterprise features a 200K token context window—equivalent to processing up to 20 30-minute sales transcripts, five comprehensive financial reports, or 250,000 lines of code in a single conversation. This isn’t just a technical specification—it’s a fundamental shift in how teams can work with AI.

Consider a quarterly business review where you need to analyze performance across multiple product lines, regions, and time periods. Instead of manually switching between dozens of documents and losing context, teams can upload their quarterly reports, sales data, and market analysis into a single Claude conversation. Claude maintains full context across the documents, enabling comprehensive analysis that would typically require hours of manual work.

For example, a chief financial officer (CFO) team can upload Q1–Q4 reports from multiple business units and ask Claude to identify trends, anomalies, and strategic recommendations across the entire portfolio. Claude analyzes revenue patterns, identifies cost optimization opportunities, and suggests strategic pivots—all while maintaining context across the complete dataset.

### Enterprise-grade security and compliance

Security is built into every aspect of Claude for Enterprise and includes: SSO or SAML authentication System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) provisioning for automated user management Comprehensive audit logs Custom data retention controls Granular role-based permissions that give IT teams complete control over information access

The following screenshot shows the **Identity and access** menu in **Settings**.

Figure 2: Setting up SSO

The following screenshot shows the **Domain management** menu in **Global SSO Configuration** in the **Identity and access** window.

Figure 3: Identity and access options

A financial services organization can use role-based permissions to control access to sensitive client data. Portfolio analysts access client performance data within their designated business units, and senior managers have cross-portfolio visibility. Compliance officers maintain audit access across interactions, with automated trails tracking every request involving regulated data.

### Native integrations and MCP

Claude for Enterprise works within your existing workflows through native integrations with GitHub and Google Workspace, plus extensible connectivity through MCP. The extensive pre-built MCP integrations—including Atlassian (Jira or Confluence), Zapier, Linear, Asana, and more—allow teams to connect Claude to their entire technology stack.

The MCP opens possibilities for custom integrations with most tools or services your organization uses. For instance, a DevOps team can use MCP to connect Claude to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions for automated report generation and [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for document analysis workflows. When [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) alarms trigger, Claude can analyze the relevant logs stored in Amazon S3, correlate issues with recent deployments, and generate incident reports while triggering Lambda functions for automated remediation.

## Collaborative projects and knowledge sharing

Projects in Claude for Enterprise create collaborative workspaces where teams can share knowledge bases, set custom instructions, and work together on complex challenges. Each project can include relevant documents, establish specific guidelines for how Claude should respond, and maintain shared context across team interactions.

An infrastructure team can maintain their runbooks, deployment guides, and troubleshooting procedures in a project in Anthropic’s Claude that connects to [Amazon DocumentDB](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/) for knowledge base storage and [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates for infrastructure documentation. Meanwhile, a marketing team can use projects to collaborate on campaign analysis, sharing customer research documents and brand guidelines within a shared workspace that integrates with their AWS analytics infrastructure.

### Streamlined enterprise procurement

Because Claude for Enterprise purchases are made in AWS Marketplace, you benefit from the following:

* Consolidated AWS billing
* Centralized subscription management
* Integration with your existing AWS procurement processes
* Integration with existing support structures

This alleviates the need for separate vendor management processes while using your existing AWS relationship.
