In January 2024, we welcomed the first cohort of learners of [AWS Cloud Institute](https://aws.amazon.com/training/aws-cloud-institute/), a comprehensive program designed to equip aspiring cloud builders with the skills needed for high-demand roles in cloud technology. Together, we’ve learned a lot along the way, worked extremely hard, and the learners in the program have built incredible, practical cloud skills.

Today, we’re thrilled to celebrate the graduation of this inaugural cohort of AWS Cloud Institute learners, marking a significant milestone in their journey toward launching successful careers in cloud development. Throughout the program, this exceptional group of individuals not only honed their technical expertise but also became part of a dynamic and supportive learning community, fostering collaboration and growth along the way.

In today’s rapidly evolving tech landscape, the demand for cloud skills has never been more critical. By 2026, more than [90% of organizations worldwide will feel the impact of the IT skills crisis](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52128824), with potential losses reaching $5.5 trillion due to product delays, impaired competitiveness, and lost business opportunities. Despite this challenging landscape, these graduates are ready to meet this growing demand with skills that position them at the forefront of talent that today’s employers are seeking.

## A structured path to a cloud career

This graduating class represents a group of individuals from diverse backgrounds who began their journey with varying levels of technical experience. Through nine comprehensive courses, 150+ hands-on AWS labs, and two capstone projects, they’ve transformed into AI-minded cloud developers ready to make an impact in roles such as Cloud Application Developer, DevOps Engineer, and Cloud Support Engineer.

What makes this achievement particularly remarkable is that many of our graduates started with no technical background at all. Take Nora, for example, a graduate who worked as a veterinary technician for more than a decade before enrolling in AWS Cloud Institute. Though the process of pivoting her career was daunting at times, knowing she was part of a group of learners working through the learning and transition to tech together was a big support along the way.

“Having Slack and personal interaction has been great. It’s easy to do your own thing…but this still feels like a classroom. I’m connecting with people, communicating with them constantly.”

The program’s structure and curriculum have proven invaluable for graduates like Moises, who noted, “It would have been nerve-wracking to have to learn everything on the job. For job interviews, now I have a reason they should hire me over others: I have hands-on experience.” AWS Cloud Institute’s core curriculum includes hands-on experience includes real-world problem-solving, group collaboration, and projects driven by actual customer use cases.

## Professional skill development and AWS Certification preparation

Beyond technical skills, graduates have developed crucial professional capabilities in communication, problem-solving, and teamwork. They’ve participated in tech talks and recruitment events with AWS customers and partners, building valuable industry connections. As Sherri, another graduate, expressed, “It’s been a great experience. I’ve been in the same field and pay structure forever and I’m excited to get into a career that I’m passionate about. It’s really given me great critical thinking skills. It gives me hope and confidence that I can actually do better for myself.”

The program’s inclusion of AWS Certification preparation and vouchers for exams has equipped graduates with industry-recognized credentials. According to research, [69% of professionals report AWS Training helped increase their earnings](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/aws-training-and-certification-provide-positive-roi-to-learners/#:~:text=Greater%20earning%20potential%20and%20job,result%20of%20earning%20AWS%20Certifications.), and [74% credit AWS Certification as the reason for higher earnings](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certification-prep/). Furthermore, employers are willing to [pay an average of 47% more for IT workers with AI skills](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/how-ai-changes-workplaces-aws-report) – a capability our graduates have developed through practical projects like building AI applications.

## Role-ready candidates and industry support

Looking ahead, our graduates are entering a job market where their skills are in high demand. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts [cloud employment opportunities will grow by 15% from 2021 to 2031](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/), significantly faster than the average for all occupations. With AI and machine learning being the biggest focus areas for IT leaders, our graduates’ AI-minded approach to development positions them perfectly for these opportunities.

AWS Cloud Institute’s success is also attributed to its collaboration with organizations like Accenture, Brookstone, Slalom, SoftwareOne, and TekSystems Global Services, who have helped shape the curriculum and engaged with learners throughout their journey. This industry alignment ensures graduates are prepared with the exact skills and experiences that employers are looking for.

“The scarcity of individuals with cloud skills is a major concern for organizations and we’re thrilled to play a part in helping to solve this challenge,” said Kevin Kelly, Director of AWS Cloud Institute. “We’re so proud of this first graduating cohort and are excited to follow their many successes ahead. We want to thank our learners for trusting us on this journey.”

## A new generation of builders

As we celebrate this milestone, we’re reminded that this is just the beginning. These graduates represent the first wave of a new generation of cloud builders who will help organizations innovate and transform in the digital age. Their success demonstrates that with the right structure, support, and determination, anyone can launch a rewarding career in cloud computing.

To our 2024 graduating class: congratulations on your achievement! You’ve not only gained technical expertise, but have also become part of a growing community of cloud professionals. As you step into your new roles, remember that you’re not just starting a job – you’re embarking on a career that will help shape the future of technology.
