When we launched the [AWS Generative AI Innovation Center](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/innovation-center/) in 2023, we had one clear goal: help customers turn AI potential into real business value. We’ve already guided thousands of customers across industries from financial services to healthcare—including Formula 1, FOX, GovTech Singapore, Itaú Unibanco, Nasdaq, NFL, RyanAir, and S&P Global—from AI experimentation to full-scale deployment, driving millions of dollars in productivity gains and transforming customer experiences. Now, as AI evolves toward more autonomous, agentic systems, we’re announcing an additional $100 million investment in the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center to help customers pioneer this next wave of AI innovation.

## Proven results through collaborative innovation

The AWS Generative AI Innovation Center delivers results by empowering customers to innovate freely and maximize value through trusted AI solutions. We combine Amazon’s decades of AI leadership with deep technical knowledge and extensive, secure real-world deployment experience. Our global team of AI scientists, strategists, and engineers works directly alongside customers and partners to solve the most complex challenges in AI implementation. Through our working backward approach, we deliver deployment-ready solutions in as little as 45 days—starting with real customer needs and maintaining a production-first mindset that blends advanced science with practical application. Our experience with thousands of customers has revealed a clear pattern: the most successful AI implementations start with a strong data and cloud foundation. Many of our customers begin their AI journey by first establishing robust cloud and data practices on AWS—centralizing their data lakes, implementing governance, and modernizing their analytics capabilities, which then becomes the springboard for transformative AI initiatives.

To help more customers, we also launched the [AWS Generative AI Partner Innovation Alliance](https://press.aboutamazon.com/2024/11/aws-announces-generative-ai-partner-innovation-alliance-to-globally-scale-success-of-its-generative-ai-innovation-center), a carefully selected global network of systems integrators and consulting firms. These partners apply our center’s battle-tested methodologies and assets to help customers rapidly scale from AI experimentation to enterprise-wide implementation.

“Two years has flown by quickly, and I couldn’t be prouder of how the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center has helped thousands of customers tackle their most complex AI challenges—from medical research to banking to startup innovation,” said Sri Elaprolu, Director for the Center. “This new $100 million AWS investment empowers us to continue innovating alongside our customers.”

The following are some examples of how the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center customers are turning AI potential into real business results, such as accelerating drug discovery, transforming government services, optimizing manufacturing operations, and more:

[Jabil](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/jabil-manufacturing-transformation-generative-ai/), a global leader in engineering, supply chain, and manufacturing solutions with over 100 sites worldwide and 140,000 employees, is a Fortune 500 company that collaborated with AWS and AWS Partners to achieve a 74% reduction in data processing times, improving operational efficiency. In just 3 weeks, they deployed an intelligent shopfloor assistant using [Amazon Q](https://aws.amazon.com/q/) to connect their databases, which now processes over 1,700 policies and specifications across multiple languages, reducing their average troubleshooting time while improving diagnostic accuracy.

[Warner Bros. Discovery Sports Europe](https://media.wbdsports.com/post/warner-bros-discovery-launches-generative-ai-powered-cycling-cen) developed an AI-powered solution, Cycling Central Intelligence (CCI), using [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), Anthropic’s Claude 3.5, and other AWS services. CCI processes hundreds of documents and databases, so mountain bike racing commentators can access information through natural language queries, dramatically reducing research time and enhancing storytelling capabilities.

The [BMW Group](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/innovating-at-speed-bmws-generative-ai-solution-for-cloud-incident-analysis/) manages over 23 million vehicles connected to its Connected Vehicle Backend hosted on AWS, generating approximately 17 billion requests and 197 terabytes of data per day. BMW and AWS continually work together to make these processes even more efficient. One of these innovations is an AI solution that automatically analyzes system architecture, logs, and infrastructure changes. The solution can identify root causes of service disruptions in minutes, a task that previously required hours of manual investigation across multiple teams.

[Splash Music](https://radioinfo.com.au/audioinfo/ai-powered-music-creation-for-everyone-splash-music/), an AI music generation startup, developed an AI-powered music production platform on AWS that converts simple hummed tunes into fully-produced songs. Using [Amazon SageMaker HyperPod](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/hyperpod/) and [AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium/) chips, it efficiently processes petabyte-scale music datasets and large language models (LLMs). This approach reduced infrastructure costs by over 50% while enabling rapid scaling. In 5 months, users created over 10,000 AI-generated songs (“wemixes”), garnering 400 million impressions. The platform’s ability to turn basic audio input (just a voice) into complex musical compositions expands creative possibilities for both amateur and professional musicians.

The PGA TOUR has transformed its content workflow by implementing an intelligent image selection system powered by [Amazon Nova](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/), an AI solution that automatically evaluates player photos against sophisticated branding and emotional criteria, analyzing multiple images to select the perfect shot for tournament previews and recaps. By replacing manual review processes with the advanced capabilities of Amazon Nova, the PGA TOUR achieved 70% cost savings compared to alternative AI models while maintaining its high editorial standards.

## The agentic future is here

Today’s investment is particularly significant as we see AI evolving from systems that simply respond to prompts to autonomous agents capable of reasoning, planning, and executing complex tasks. This evolution holds immense economic potential, with [Gartner’s projection](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-06-25-gartner-predicts-over-40-percent-of-agentic-ai-projects-will-be-canceled-by-end-of-2027) that 15% of work decisions will be made autonomously by agentic AI by 2028. Beyond economic projections, agents represent a larger shift in how work is done and how value is both captured and created. With agents, humans can focus less on rote work and more on designing responsibly, thinking strategically, and innovating creatively.

At AWS, we are building a future where these advanced agentic capabilities can extend and enhance your team’s capabilities, while still recognizing the irreplaceable value of human judgment, empathy, and responsible decision making. Our approach to implementing these powerful technologies emphasizes clear governance, accountability, explainability, and robust privacy controls. Amazon applies this approach internally, testing services with our teams before releasing them to customers. For example, Amazon is using agentic AI to power the new Alexa+ and in our fulfillment network for inventory placement and demand forecasting. AWS is using agents in internal sales and marketing activities and is actively deploying agentic tools and accelerators to deliver unprecedented speed-to-value for customers. We’re not just building agents to reimagine services delivery—we’re already transforming how [AWS Professional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services/) operates today.

## Agentic AI applications delivering results

Customers working with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center are already seeing promise and value with agentic AI:

[Syngenta](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/syngenta-develops-a-generative-ai-assistant-to-support-sales-representatives-using-amazon-bedrock-agents/), a global agriculture leader, has harnessed AWS’s AI capabilities to develop Cropwise AI, an innovative solution designed to help farmers navigate complex agricultural challenges. When a farmer seeks guidance, Cropwise AI’s advanced system springs into action. Its sophisticated agentic AI architecture analyzes weather patterns, soil conditions, crop growth stages, and product information simultaneously. This approach enables real-time synthesis of insights from various data sources, delivering comprehensive farming recommendations with unprecedented speed.

Moving beyond traditional sequential AI processing, Cropwise AI empowers farmers to make swift, informed decisions in the face of ever-changing environmental factors, adapting to the dynamic nature of modern farming.

[AstraZeneca](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/highlights-from-the-2025-aws-life-sciences-symposiums-clinical-trials-track/) is building a generative AI-powered conversational analytics solution that helps their internal teams efficiently analyze healthcare professional documentation across their global markets. The resulting solution employs a dynamic workflow of specialized agents: one converting natural language to SQL queries for data retrieval, another transforming results into Python-based visualizations, and a third generating comprehensive summaries. The transition to agents enabled AstraZeneca to dramatically reduce query response times, showing a 50% improvement. This transformation enabled internal teams to uncover valuable insights about prescriber patterns and care gaps that were previously inaccessible. With the solution’s modular architecture, AstraZeneca can repurpose these agents across multiple platforms, creating a scalable foundation for future AI-driven analytics initiatives.

SonicWall is harnessing the power of specialized AI agents on AWS to transform how customers manage their firewall configurations. Their innovative solution deploys purpose-built agents that work in concert: a router agent analyzes natural language requests to determine query type, while dedicated agents simultaneously handle security policy validation and configuration generation. By orchestrating these specialized agents, SonicWall moved from a potentially vulnerable open source framework to a secure, high-performance solution in just 3 weeks. This transformation improved code maintainability by 40% and significantly reduced operational complexity. Now, managed service providers can instantly configure and upgrade firewalls, turning previously complex security tasks into streamlined, automated processes.

Yahoo Finance is on a mission to revolutionize how millions of investors access market analysis. Building on their AI-powered news summarization solution, they are developing an innovative multi-agent system where a supervisor agent will intelligently orchestrate specialized agents dedicated to analyzing breaking news, processing financial data, and interpreting SEC filings. By using these agents, Yahoo Finance can combine insights from multiple sources based on each investor query, delivering comprehensive financial analysis through a single, seamless interface with no coding experience required.
