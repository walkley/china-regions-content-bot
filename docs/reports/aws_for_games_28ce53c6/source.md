Game developers face a common challenge: building cloud expertise while staying focused on game creation. Modern games require sophisticated cloud infrastructure to handle millions of concurrent players, manage real-time multiplayer experiences, and deliver seamless global gameplay—making cloud expertise key to game development.

This guide organizes essential training resources to help you build cloud expertise, from foundational courses to hands-on workshops and industry-recognized certifications. Whether you’re an independent developer looking to scale your first game, a technical artist requiring cloud-based rendering solutions, or a studio engineer architecting large-scale gaming infrastructure, you’ll find structured guidance for every stage of your cloud gaming journey.

Our guide covers four key areas:

1. AWS Skill Builder training via its digital courses and hands-on labs
2. Practical AWS Workshops and AWS Immersion Days to implement real-world gaming solutions
3. AWS Certifications aligned with gaming technology needs
4. Additional resources including GitHub repositories, architecture guides, and educational programs

Let’s explore how these resources can help you build cloud skills and expertise that is needed for today’s game development.

## AWS Certifications

AWS Certifications validate your technical expertise in specific domains of cloud computing. These certifications are industry-recognized and demonstrate your technological knowledge on specific AWS domains. For game developers, three certifications align closely with the skills needed to build and scale games with AWS:

* [AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/?pp=cert&c=exam&z=3) is widely considered the foundational AWS Certification that demonstrates your ability to design distributed systems and applications using AWS services. The exam tests your knowledge of how to architect secure, robust, high-performing, and cost-effective infrastructure solutions, covering key services like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon S3, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon Route 53, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), as well as various compute, storage, and database options.
* [AWS Certified Developer – Associate Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/?pp=cert&c=exam&z=3) covers common games-related AWS services, with a focus on best practices for developing and maintaining applications with AWS. The exam tests your understanding of services like AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon S3, and AWS CloudFormation. You will also learn serverless application concepts, containerization, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and security best practices including IAM roles and encryption.
* [AWS Certified Advanced Networking – Specialty Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-advanced-networking-specialty/?pp=cert&c=exam&z=4) is suitable for developers designing and implementing complex games networking solutions with AWS.
