Staying relevant and ahead in the world of tech means learning new technologies and continuously upgrading your skills. If you’re a student or an early-to-mid career software development professional with aspirations to build software using generative AI, the AWS Generative AI for Developers Professional Certificate (live on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/aws-generative-ai-developers?utm_medium=institutions&utm_source=aws&utm_campaign=aws-marketing-launch-announcement-jul2025) and [edX](https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/aws-generative-ai-for-developers?utm_medium=partner-marketing&utm_source=email&utm_campaign=aws&utm_content=aws-marketing-launch-announcement-jul2025)) can be your pathway to understanding a technology that can be applied across any business.

Generative AI is a type of AI that can be used to create new content, such as text, images, or code, based on trained data. This technology can automate tasks, streamline decision-making, and generate art and music. [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) offers a wide range of cloud computing services, including numerous services purpose-built for generative AI. By learning to use AWS generative AI services, you gain the skills to build smart apps with an aim to improve numerous aspects of software development and IT ops.

## The AWS Generative AI for Developers Professional Certificate

The AWS Generative AI for Developers Professional Certificate gives you a solid foundation in generative AI, specifically using AWS services such as [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) and [Amazon Q Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/).

This certificate program guides you through the building blocks of generative AI, helping you understand where it sits within the broader scope of AI capabilities and key concepts such as [foundation models (FMs)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/foundation-models/), [prompts](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/prompt-engineering/), and inference. Moving beyond theory and concepts into practical application, you gain access to instructions for hands-on labs so you can practice using Amazon Bedrock APIs and Amazon Q Developer with real-world scenarios.

### Course 1: Getting Started with AWS Generative AI for Developers

In the first course, you learn how to invoke FMs and interpret their responses using the low-level Amazon Bedrock APIs. The course covers [Amazon Bedrock Runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_Operations_Amazon_Bedrock_Runtime.html) APIs, including basic operations like InvokeModel, InvokeModelWithResponseStream, and asynchronous invocations using the StartAsyncInvoke API. You learn to implement streaming responses, understand provisioned throughput, and apply guardrails to use AI responsibly.

You explore various use cases for Amazon Q Developer and experience demonstrations of how the agentic capabilities of Amazon Q Developer can speed up software development practices.

### Course 2: Generative AI Applications with Amazon Bedrock

Building on the basics you learned in the first course, you then dive into additional features of Amazon Bedrock in the second course. You explore [Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/), an Amazon Bedrock capability you can use to implement the entire RAG workflow, from ingestion to retrieval and prompt augmentation. The course guides you to create and manage knowledge bases, integrating them into your applications to provide context-aware, domain-specific AI interactions.

The program covers [Amazon Bedrock Prompt Management](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/prompt-management/) and [Amazon Bedrock Flows](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/flows/), teaching you to create versioned reusable prompt templates and design workflows that chain multiple AI operations. You learn about generative AI agents ([agentic AI](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/agentic-ai/)) for task automation, configuring and deploying [Amazon Bedrock Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/), and integrating agents with various tools to create more autonomous systems.

### Course 3: Amazon Bedrock Customization, Optimization & Automation

The final course focuses on customizing, optimizing, and automating your AI solutions for efficiency. You explore model customization techniques, including fine-tuning and continued pre-training. The course dives into advanced optimization strategies, including working with [Amazon Bedrock Evaluations](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/evaluations/) to perform evaluation jobs that assess and compare model performance and implementing prompt caching for improved response times. In the automation section, you discover how to streamline AI workflows using [Amazon Bedrock Data Automation](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/bda/) to process and transform large datasets. You encounter multiple examples of how to use Amazon Q Developer on the command line to automate tasks.

## Hands-on learning and self-guided pace

One of the highlights of this program is its hands-on learning. You get to work on projects in Python using a locally run Jupyter notebook to invoke the Amazon Bedrock APIs, and you use the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). These labs give you the experience you need to apply these skills in real-world roles now and into the future.

This professional certificate offers approximately 15–20 hours of learning across three courses, which you can complete at your pace. Whether you want to improve existing applications with generative AI or build new systems, you’ll acquire the know-how to make an impact.

## Conclusion

The AWS Generative AI for Developers Professional Certificate (on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/aws-generative-ai-developers?utm_medium=institutions&utm_source=aws&utm_campaign=aws-marketing-launch-announcement-jul2025) and [edX](https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/aws-generative-ai-for-developers?utm_medium=partner-marketing&utm_source=email&utm_campaign=aws&utm_content=aws-marketing-launch-announcement-jul2025)) is an accelerator for your future—a future where you’re using generative AI to build solutions and lead significant advancements in software development and IT ops.

By the end of this program, you’ll be designing, developing, and deploying generative AI solutions on AWS. These are skills that are in high demand in modern cloud computing. Now’s the time to learn, understand, and apply all that generative AI has to offer. Enroll in the professional certificate today and start building on AWS.
