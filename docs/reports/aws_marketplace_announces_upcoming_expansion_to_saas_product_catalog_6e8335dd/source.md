# AWS Marketplace announces upcoming expansion to SaaS product catalog

by Lauren Drigotas, Arun Saksena, and Emily Garrett on 25 FEB 2025 in [Announcements](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsmarketplace/category/post-types/announcements/ "View all posts in Announcements"), [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsmarketplace/category/software/aws-marketplace/ "View all posts in AWS Marketplace"), [Featured](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsmarketplace/category/featured/ "View all posts in Featured"), [Launch](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsmarketplace/category/news/launch/ "View all posts in Launch"), [News](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsmarketplace/category/news/ "View all posts in News"), [Software](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsmarketplace/category/software/ "View all posts in Software") [Permalink](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsmarketplace/aws-marketplace-announces-upcoming-expansion-to-saas-product-catalog/) Share

AWS Marketplace is excited to announce an upcoming expansion of our Software as a Service (SaaS) Policy, effective May 1, 2025. This will expand our catalog to welcome all SaaS products in [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace), regardless of where the product is deployed. This marks an evolution from our previous requirement that SaaS products must be partially deployed on AWS infrastructure. Expanding the catalog will give our customers access to a broader range of software products. With the policy change, there will also be a new badge available on product listings that will make it easy to identify products that are deployed on AWS infrastructure.

This policy update is a direct response to valuable feedback from our customers and AWS Partners who have asked for a more comprehensive procurement experience. For customers, this means access to an expanded catalog of products with the convenience of fast [SaaS procurement](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/features/software-as-a-service-saas) and consolidated billing and management. Partners will be able to list their complete software portfolios in AWS Marketplace, streamlining their go-to-market strategy and reaching more AWS customers. Importantly, products 100% deployed on AWS infrastructure will receive a “Deployed on AWS” badge and will continue to count towards additional customer benefits. This will help organizations maximize their cloud investments while procuring the products that best fit their needs.

## Expanding choice and extending the benefits of AWS Marketplace to more products

This change will expand the selection of products available for customers in AWS Marketplace to include SaaS products that are deployed on AWS, deployed on other cloud infrastructures, and deployed on-premises.

With expanded choice, customers will be able to take advantage of the [benefits of AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/mp/marketplace-service/overview/) for more software purchases, including:

* Enhanced discovery and evaluation: Discover thousands of software products, compare products to find the best fit for your business, and get hands-on experience before purchasing with access to free trials.
* Streamlined procurement: Optimize time-to-value with standard contracts and flexible payment options. Test software, pay as you go, and negotiate custom terms and pricing.
* Cost optimization: Reduce SaaS sprawl by consolidating your software spend with AWS Marketplace billing. Keep track of multiple accounts, and access tools to help you set budgets and track spend.

## Discover products that are “Deployed on AWS” with new badging

While AWS Marketplace is expanding the catalog to offer more choice, customers will also be able to identify products in AWS Marketplace that are verified as “Deployed on AWS”. Starting May 1, 2025, product detail pages will display the deployed on AWS badge. SaaS products “Deployed on AWS” can be deployed quickly, leverage the strong security posture and operational excellence of AWS infrastructure, and may qualify for additional AWS customer benefits.

## More opportunities for AWS Marketplace sellers

This expansion will allow AWS Partners to list their complete SaaS portfolios in AWS Marketplace, regardless of where their products are deployed, and will provide additional benefits for products that are “Deployed on AWS”. This balanced approach allows AWS to maintain its commitment to customer choice while rewarding AWS Partners whose products are “Deployed of AWS” to prioritize the security, reliability, and performance efficiency of their product offerings.

AWS Marketplace sellers who want their products to have the badge verifying that their products are “Deployed on AWS” must submit architecture diagrams in the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal (AMMP)](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/signin).

Learn more about what to submit and details about the changes in the [AWS Marketplace Seller Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/saas-guidelines.html#saas-architecture).

## Expanding availability for Channel Partners and Distribution Partners

This expansion will broaden the range of SaaS products that Channel and Distribution Partners can sell through AWS Marketplace or through their websites utilizing [Buy with AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/marketplace/buy-with-aws/). With these changes, AWS Partners will be able to streamline sales processes and scale operations more efficiently across all products they sell.

## Key Takeaways

By removing hosting restrictions while maintaining clear identification of products “Deployed on AWS”, AWS Marketplace will offer:

* Greater SaaS selection and choice for customers
* More opportunities for AWS Marketplace sellers
* Streamlined software discovery, procurement, and management for more products
* Clear identification of products that are deployed on AWS, that leverage the strong security posture and operational excellence of AWS infrastructure, and provide additional customer benefits.

For businesses looking to streamline their software procurement processes, these changes represent a step forward in simplifying the procurement journey with increased selection in AWS Marketplace.
