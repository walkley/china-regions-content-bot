# AWS re/Start and Momentum: Building pathways for women in tech

by Nicole Price on 31 MAR 2025 in [AWS Training and Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/category/aws-training-and-certification/ "View all posts in AWS Training and Certification"), [Customer Solutions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/category/post-types/customer-solutions/ "View all posts in Customer Solutions"), [Thought Leadership](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/category/post-types/thought-leadership/ "View all posts in Thought Leadership") [Permalink](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/aws-re-start-women-in-tech/) Share

Organizations seeking to diversify their cloud talent pipeline have a unique opportunity through [AWS re/Start](https://aws.amazon.com/training/restart/) and our collaborating organizations that support underrepresented groups, minorities, displaced individuals, young people, and more. As we celebrate Women’s History Month, our collaboration with [Momentum](https://momentum.org/)—a Calgary-based community economic development organization—demonstrates how workforce development initiatives can help build a more inclusive tech industry while strengthening technical teams.

In this post, you’ll learn about how AWS re/Start approaches developing cloud talent, how our graduates bring value to employers, and how your organization can participate.

## Developing cloud talent through strategic collaboration

AWS re/Start is a comprehensive workforce development program that prepares diverse talent for entry to mid-level cloud roles. Working with collaborating organizations worldwide, we deliver free, cohort-based training that combines technical skills development—from Linux and Python to core AWS services—with professional preparation. No technology background is required; instead, we seek candidates with enthusiasm for launching cloud careers and commitment to completing the program.

In collaboration with Momentum, we’re creating concrete pathways for women to enter the cloud computing industry. The AWS re/Start Tech Training for Women program exemplifies our commitment to diversifying the tech workforce through comprehensive, hands-on training. This ongoing collaboration, with additional cohorts scheduled for later this year, follows the standard AWS re/Start curriculum while uniquely focusing on women in the Calgary area.

During the intensive 20-week program, participants earn their [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) certification while gaining hands-on technical experience through real-world scenarios. They develop essential professional skills, receive guidance from industry mentors, and connect with employers for work placement opportunities upon graduation.

The program’s impact is best illustrated through our graduates’ experiences, like Mervis Elebe, who shares, “As a new immigrant, AWS re/Start didn’t just provide technical training—it opened doors to Calgary’s technology ecosystem. The program has enabled me to build a sustainable future for my daughters while contributing to the growing cloud computing industry.”

## Building the pipeline: Upcoming opportunities

We’re excited to announce that a cohort of newly certified AWS Certified Cloud Practitioners will be seeking work placements this spring. These professionals bring diverse backgrounds—from software engineering to business analysis—and are ready to contribute to your organization’s cloud initiatives. Additional cohorts are scheduled for later this year, providing ongoing opportunities to engage with skilled cloud talent.

Organizations can contribute to building a more inclusive tech future in several ways. By hosting work placements for program graduates, providing mentorship opportunities, and considering these newly certified professionals for full-time roles, employers become active partners in developing the next generation of cloud talent. These engagement options are flexible and can be customized to suit your organization’s needs and capacity.

## Looking ahead

The AWS re/Start program represents our ongoing commitment to breaking down barriers in tech. By combining the global resources of AWS with Momentum’s local expertise, we’re creating sustainable pathways for women to build rewarding careers in cloud computing.
