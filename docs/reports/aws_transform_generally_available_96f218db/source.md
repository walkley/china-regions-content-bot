*AWS Transform Now Generally Available to Accelerate Enterprise Migration and Modernization*

You’re likely aware of the huge appetite organizations of all sizes have to leverage AI technology to rethink their business and deliver intelligent, data-driven outcomes faster. Recent research shows that 64% of enterprises are investing in AI in 2025, and 63% are accelerating cloud migration plans. The correlation between these is important for you: migrating your mission-critical applications and data to build a trusted foundation is what transforms good AI into great AI.

This increasing need to move to the cloud doesn’t change the fact that migrating and modernizing workloads remains one of the most tedious (but critical) projects for your enterprise to undertake. At AWS, we’ve spent nearly two decades leading enterprise migration and modernization, helping tens of thousands of customers like you transform their businesses. Despite that, 75% of enterprise workloads remain on premises, with 70% of Fortune 500 companies still running on software written over two decades ago. And traditional migration and modernization projects often stretch to 18 months or more, creating a bottleneck in your path to AI innovation. In 2024, we asked ourselves: What if we could combine our 19 years of migration expertise with the latest advancements in AI to eliminate bottlenecks and accelerate transformation projects from years to months or even weeks? The result is AWS Transform, a revolutionary service that uses agentic AI to accelerate and simplify the migration and modernization of your infrastructure, applications, and code.

# Introducing AWS Transform: The Future of Your Enterprise Modernization

AWS Transform (previewed as Amazon Q Developer transformation capabilities at re:Invent 2024) uses specialized AI agents to remove the heavy lifting and automate complex migration and modernization tasks for your VMware, mainframe, and .NET workloads, delivering completed transformation projects up to 4x faster. This new agentic AI service uses AWS advancements in foundational models, LLMs, machine learning, graph neural networks, automated reasoning, and AI infrastructure to deliver an entirely new migration and modernization experience for you. And the results from our preview speak for themselves:

* AWS Transform agent for .NET can modernize Windows-based .NET applications to Linux up to four times faster than traditional methods and realize up to 40% savings in licensing costs.
* AWS Transform agent for mainframe can decompose monolithic z/OS COBOL applications into components that can be run in the cloud in minutes instead of months.
* AWS Transform agent for VMware can automate the conversion of on-premises VMware network configurations to AWS equivalents up to 80 times faster than manual approaches.

AWS Transform uses a chat experience that acts as a knowledgeable transformation assistant, helping you specify objectives, share project context, assess business plans and cost savings, review and adapt transformation plans, review and approve code and infrastructure suggestions and more. AWS Transform also brings together your cross-functional teams in a unified web experience where you can review tasks, track progress, and collaborate throughout the project keeping you in control of transformation plans for your most complex legacy applications including:

# Modernizing Windows-based .NET Applications to reduce costs by up to 40%

The AWS Transform agent for .NET accelerates your .NET Framework application porting from Windows to Linux, reducing operating costs by up to 40%. This cost savings is achieved by reducing your Windows Server licensing costs, version upgrades, maintenance, and end-of-support challenges, while also shrinking transformation costs across analysis, planning and refactoring. Using the .NET agent, you can chat using natural language to share transformation objectives and project context, and have AWS Transform analyze dependencies, apply domain expertise from past modernization journeys to develop customized modernization plans, and autonomously transform code, execute unit tests, generate transformation summary, and validate Linux-readiness.

AWS Transform enhances performance and scalability of your applications by transforming .NET Framework application code to cross-platform .NET which is Linux ready, and porting private packages, automating unit test execution, and providing explainable transformation decisions. This new agent enables you to transform hundreds of applications in parallel with consistent results through a unified web experience, streamlining collaboration across your teams and empowering you to efficiently tackle large-scale modernization projects.

> “By using AWS Transform for .NET to port one of our .NET Framework applications to .NET Core 8, we reduced 70% of the modernization effort, with 100% success. As we continue our modernization process for the entire core application, we estimate a total development time and effort reduction of up to 80%. The next steps include incorporating one of our major backend applications into the transformation effort from Windows to Linux, deploying it on Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate as microservices.” – Enrique Zazueta, Grupo Tress Internacional (GTI), Director of Software Development

# Accelerating Mainframe Modernization from Years to Months

You can now streamline your entire modernization process with the AWS Transform agent for mainframe, accelerating timelines by up to 50% while reducing risk and complexity. Through the chat interface, you can define high-level modernization goals and negotiate your job plan. When you’re ready, AWS Transform processes your mainframe applications written in COBOL, JCL (Job Control Language) and those relying on CICS (Customer Information Control System) transaction manager, BMS (Basic Mapping Support) screens, DB2 databases, and VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) data files.

You’ll benefit from advanced code analysis that rapidly identifies dependencies and missing files, reducing downstream project delays. Using Graph Neural Networks, you can decompose your monolithic applications into manageable modules, enabling targeted modernization approaches while preserving your critical business logic. Throughout the project, AWS Transform acts as your AI assistant, learning from your progress and answering questions about your programs based on generated technical documentation.

When you’re refactoring applications, you can convert your COBOL, JCL, and DB2 to Java and Postgres, leveraging state machines and state transition graphs for enhanced accuracy. For reimagining your applications, you’ll get comprehensive technical documentation, business rules, and logical flows extracted from millions of lines of your code. With intelligent orchestration of AI agents, you can modernize your mainframe applications in the cloud with greater speed, simplicity, and confidence while preserving your institutional knowledge through detailed documentation.

> “By leveraging AWS Transform’s AI agent functionality, we were able to significantly streamline the process that would typically require experienced engineers to accurately interpret, document, and verify the relationships between programs and the logic of business codes. For instance, in the analysis of complex components—a task that would normally take approximately one month—we confirmed that the same process could be completed within just about one week. This represents a major step forward in enhancing both efficiency and productivity.” – Hitoshi Okayama, General Manager, Broker Dealers System Service Department, Nomura Research Institute, Ltd.
