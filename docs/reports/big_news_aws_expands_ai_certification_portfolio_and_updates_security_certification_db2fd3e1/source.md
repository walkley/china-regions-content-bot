# We’ve made significant updates to our certification portfolio, reinforcing our commitment to helping professionals validate their expertise in artificial intelligence and security.

## Beta registration is now open: AWS Certified Generative AI Developer – Professional

We’re excited to announce that beta registration is now open for our newest certification: [AWS Certified Generative AI Developer – Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-generative-ai-developer-professional). This certification will validate a developer’s ability to effectively integrate foundation models into applications and business workflows. Software developers and AI engineers can showcase their expertise in building production-ready AI solutions using foundation models, RAG architectures, and vector databases. Registration for the [beta exam](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/policies/before-testing/#pricing-policies) is open, with beta participants receiving a special Early Adopter badge upon passing. The beta exam is 205 minutes, and made up of 85 questions. We encourage you to please visit the [test day policies page](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/policies/during-testing/) for helpful information regarding testing rules, including breaks, to ensure you are prepared for this comprehensive exam.

The [Exam Prep Plan: AWS Certified Generative AI Developer – Professional](https://skillbuilder.aws/category/exam-prep/generative-ai-developer-professional-aip-c01) is now available on [AWS Skill Builder](https://skillbuilder.aws/). The Exam Prep Plan includes practice assessments with exam-style questions, hands-on practice through AWS SimuLearn, and lessons that review each exam domain and task. The plan also references digital role-based training to refresh your AWS knowledge and skills.

For developers seeking to fill in deeper technical gaps in knowledge, our new [Advanced Generative AI Development on AWS classroom course](https://skillbuilder.aws/learn/YACQQYH17K/advanced-generative-ai-development-on-aws/1QJSMSPUVB) covers foundation model implementation, retrieval augmentation with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, agentic AI development with Bedrock AgentCore, and enterprise integration patterns in a hands-on, three-day format that aligns with the role’s focus on production-ready solutions.

### Complementary microcredential now available

To provide a comprehensive validation path for developers, we’re also launching the [AWS Agentic AI Demonstrated microcredential](https://skillbuilder.aws/category/type/microcredentials). While the [AWS Certified Generative AI Developer – Professional](https://skillbuilder.aws/category/exam-prep/generative-ai-developer-professional-aip-c01) certification validates broad technical knowledge, this new microcredential allows developers to demonstrate their practical implementation skills in a provisioned AWS environment.

The AWS Agentic AI Demonstrated microcredential specifically assesses your ability to:

* Implement AI solutions using AWS services
* Identify and troubleshoot issues in real-world scenarios
* Deploy and manage AI workloads in production environments

## AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty retirement

As part of our AI/ML certification portfolio evolution, we’ve announced the retirement of the [AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/) certification. The last date to take this exam will be March 31, 2026. For anyone who has already earned Machine Learning – Specialty, their certification will remain active through the original expiration date. Current certification holders can continue their AI/ML journey through our expanded portfolio, including the AWS Certified AI Practitioner, AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer – Associate, AWS Certified Data Engineer – Associate, and the new AWS Certified Generative AI Developer – Professional certifications.

## Updated security certification

The [AWS Certified Security – Specialty](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-security-specialty/) exam has been updated to address the evolving security landscape. The new version (SCS-C03) expands coverage of emerging technologies, with dedicated focus on generative AI and machine learning security. To better serve security professionals, we’ve restructured the exam domains, creating distinct sections for Detection and Incident Response capabilities. Registration for the updated exam (SCS-C03) is now open. Security professionals interested in the current version (SCS-C02) have until December 1, 2025, to complete their certification. To support candidates preparing for the new exam, there is an updated [exam prep plan for SCS-C03](https://skillbuilder.aws/category/exam-prep/security-specialty-scs-c03) through AWS Skill Builder. Candidates can also refresh their AWS knowledge and skills by enrolling in the [AWS Security Engineer Advanced Learning Plan](https://skillbuilder.aws/learning-plan/NTDPRSFC3F/aws-security-engineer-advanced-learning-plan/VUD51DEB41), which covers crucial aspects of cloud security needed to perform a Security Engineer role using the AWS Cloud. The training focuses on 3 primary functions including, proactive planning, active monitoring and responsive action.

These updates reflect AWS’s commitment to helping organizations build teams with the expertise needed to implement secure, scalable AI solutions. Visit the AWS Training and Certification blog to learn more about these updates and start your certification journey.
