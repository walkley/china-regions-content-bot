Each year, we honor members of the **[AWS Partner Network](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/)** (APN) from around the globe that play key roles in helping customers drive innovation and build solutions on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Announced during a Partner Awards Gala at [AWS re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/), the **2025 Geo and Global AWS Partner Awards** recognize a wide range of partners whose business models have embraced specialization, innovation, and cooperation over the past year. Geo and Global AWS Partner Awards honor partners whose business models continue to evolve and thrive on AWS as they work with customers.

For the fourth year in a row, the Geo and Global AWS Partner Awards included a self-nomination process across several categories, which are awarded at both the geo and global level. All AWS Partners were invited to participate and submit a nomination, and award submissions were reviewed by a third party (Canalys) and selected with special emphasis placed on customer success use cases presented in the nomination form.

There are a number of data-driven award categories as well, which was comprised of a unique set of metrics that helped measure AWS Partners’ performance within the past year. Canalys audited the datasets used to ensure all measurements and calculations were objective and correct in nature. In addition to highlighting winners across each award category, finalists are also being recognized as part of the data-driven award categories.

A panel of AWS experts selected the winners and finalists based on strict criteria with third-party audit conducted by Canalys. Please join us in congratulating these AWS Partners for their success!
