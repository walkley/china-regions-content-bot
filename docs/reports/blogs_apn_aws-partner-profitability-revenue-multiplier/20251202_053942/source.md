As we stand at the intersection of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, AWS Partners face an extraordinary business opportunity. With AI services projected to reach $267 billion by 2030, per Omdia, and cloud adoption accelerating across industries, the focus of AWS Partners isn’t just on expanding their capabilities but also to strategically position themselves to capture this unprecedented opportunity.

A new [AWS Partner Ecosystem Multiplier (PEM) 2025 Study](https://aws.amazon.com/resources/analyst-reports/omdia/global-whitepaper-ardm-25-partner-ecosystem-multiplier-the-aws-opportunity/?trk=a7c6edb5-4a11-4597-b4b2-57d23b3f7ba3&sc_channel=el), by Omdia reveals that **AWS Partners can now achieve up to US$7.13 in services revenue for every $1 of AWS technology sold**, demonstrating the significant value creation potential within the AWS Partner Network (APN) by delivering comprehensive cloud solutions and services.

In 2022, we introduced the **AWS Partner Profitability Framework** (*Figure 1*), an intuitive and reliable way to maximize business value with the AWS Partner Network (APN). The new PEM 2025 study findings further reinforce that AWS Partners that achieve the US$7.13 multiplier, are those that have deeper AWS engagement and offer a breadth of services. Partners deliver more impact to customers and boost earning potential by moving across and up the Partner Profitability Framework and collaborating with other Partners.

## Key findings

- AWS Partners can reach a US$7.13 multiplier for every US$1 of AWS sold. Partners achieving this level of multiplier are able to provide a breadth of services across the entire customer lifecycle.
- Compared to the [2022 AWS Partner Ecosystem Multiplier Study](https://aws.amazon.com/resources/analyst-reports/Canalys/global-ar-report-ardm-partner-ecosystem-multiplier/), all Partner categories (noted below) saw an increase in PEM opportunity within the AWS Partner Network.
- 82% of Partners are delivering some form of AI as part of their AWS transformation delivery to end customers.
- 64% of Partners are actively using AWS Marketplace as part of their overall go-to-market strategy.
- While Partners create value across six essential service categories, advise, design, procure, build, adopt, and manage, the manage and build categories are the largest growing categories, driven by the growth of the role of AWS Marketplace and the growth of opportunity tied to generative and agentic AI.

## Multiplier’s strength is tied to the maturity and diversity of Partner services

The APN demonstrates substantial maturity, with Partners able to capture considerable revenues across the customer lifecycle. Omdia has identified four Partner maturity categories: Focused, Multi-category, Progressive, and Expert. Each demonstrates different capabilities and levels of lifecycle engagement. **The study identified that US$7.13 for every dollar spent on AWS solutions is achieved by the most mature “Expert” Partners**.

At the foundation, we find **Focused Partners**, typically smaller organizations generating a US$1.26x multiplier. They are more likely to have limited variety of services offerings with narrow or single practice scope. They operate primarily with SMB customers. Moving up, **Multi-category Partners** have begun to diversify, achieving a US$3.26x multiplier as they expand their breadth of services offerings. The journey continues with **Progressive Partners**, who have mastered multiple service categories and command an impressive US$5.78x multiplier. At the summit stand the **Expert Partners**–who have mastered the art of comprehensive service delivery, achieving the coveted US$7.13x multiplier. They are the most mature and provide a breadth of services across the customer lifecycle, guiding customers through complex digital transformations and leveraging their position to drive solutions tied explicitly to business outcomes.

**To help illustrate the range of service opportunities that Partners are offering, Omdia leveraged its Partner Ecosystem Flywheel** (Figure 2). Partners that engage across all activities of the Flywheel are better positioned to create the “spin” effect with customers, thus yielding further opportunities in the future. While Partners create value across six essential service categories, advise, design, procure, build, adopt, and manage, **the manage and build categories are the largest growing categories, driven by the growth of the role of AWS Marketplace and the growth of opportunity tied to generative and agentic AI.**

## AWS Partners path to profitability: Six key strategies to move up and across the AWS Partner Profitability Framework

To achieve the maximum 7.13x multiplier, successful Partners can capture increasing value through comprehensive offerings. As AI continues to evolve and customer needs become more sophisticated, Partners who combine technical expertise with business outcome-focused solutions will be best positioned for success. **The study identifies 6 key strategies for Partners to achieve maximum multiplier over time—the Partner’s path to profitability** (Figure 3)**.**

*Figure 3: AWS Partner’s path to profitability.*

1. **Strategic positioning with senior leaders** is critical to initial profitability and becoming trusted advisors who shape strategic decision-making throughout the customer’s lifecycle. For Line of business (LOB) leaders driving transformation initiatives, selecting and engaging the right Partners at the right time is crucial for success, particularly as they navigate industry-specific requirements including specialized security compliance, modern software architecture, and data collaboration needs.

.
2. **Expansion of services offerings** should include increasingly profitable managed services and custom software solutions, AI driven transformations, and end-to-end cloud solutions. To capture growing marketing opportunities, we recommend:
- **Strengthen your managed services capabilities** by achieving AWS Managed Services Provider (MSP) and SMB Specialization, along with adoption of Agentic AI services in your portfolio to be best positioned to capture the growing market.
- **Integrate advanced technologies like AI**: The study reveals 82% of AWS Partners are already incorporating AI solutions into their customer transformation initiatives. To establish marketing leadership, pursue AI Specialization with the new Agentic AI category – leveraging our validation agent for expedited qualification. Access AWS Data & AI Knowledge Center resources in AWS Partner Central to maximize market potential and **accelerate growth**.

.
3. **Utilize AWS Marketplace to unlock new customer budgets and recurring SaaS revenues**. 64% of AWS Partners have integrated AWS Marketplace into their go-to-market strategy, per Omdia study, leveraging it as a comprehensive platform for delivering both software and professional services solutions. This adoption has become crucial for scaling Partner success and accelerating customer outcomes. Accelerate solution development and discovery in AWS Marketplace to deliver faster business outcomes to customers with flexible pricing modes. AWS Partners can now create, list and sell multi-product solutions tailored to specific industries and customer use cases in AWS Marketplace.

.
4. **Leverage AWS Partner manager support** to unlock the 51% increased annual revenue via frequent AWS co-sell motions. To maximize co-sell opportunities with AWS, we recommend Partners focus on early business goals alignment, collaboration, optimization, and engagement with AWS Sales teams.
- Establish a dedicated co-sell point of contact in your organization and drive better co-sell outcomes by aligning goals early through a strategic business plan and AWS Marketplace strategy.
- Achieve **[AWS Specializations](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/programs/specializations/)** to demonstrate your expertise and proven success to customers and take advantage of benefits like AWS Credits, cash, proof-of-concept incentives, and joint GTM and co-sell support.
- Link your AWS Partner Central and Marketplace accounts through [AWS Partner Central Account Linking](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/11/account-linking-aws-marketplace-partner-central/) and share opportunity and leads on an ongoing basis to provide end-to-end visibility of your sales pipeline to AWS Sales.
- Using Slack Connect, Partners can collaborate in real-time with AWS account managers and Partner managers on [ACE](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/programs/ace/) co-selling opportunities.

.
5. **Work with other AWS Partners on opportunities to deliver end-to-end solutions customers** **and fully unlock the potential US$7.13 PEM opportunity**. Foster collaboration with other Partners through Partner Matchmaking in-person events and leverage [Partner Connections](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/accelerate-multi-partner-opportunities-with-partner-connections/) in AWS Partner Central to find and connect with other complementary Partners through search and AI-driven recommendations-enabling connected Partners to share joint sales opportunities within this trusted network. It optimizes multi-Partner deal management through direct collaboration between Partners and the AWS Sales team, ensuring real-time updates that lead to faster and more successful engagements.

.
6. **Deliver outcome-based pricing** for customer success by transitioning from time and materials models. Invest in customer success to drive a deeper understanding of the long-term revenue opportunities with your customers. The [**Business Outcomes Xcelerator Program**](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/business-outcomes/) offers a structured way for Partners to drive stronger business outcomes for customers by providing account planning and marketing support, co-sell enablement and driving visibility AWS Sellers.

## Building for the future

As we navigate through this exciting landscape, one thing is clear: the path to achieving the US$7.13x multiplier requires deliberate action across multiple dimensions.

Partners who combine technical excellence with strategic business acumen are positioning themselves at the forefront of this revolution. They’re building deep relationships in the C-suite, transforming themselves from vendors into trusted strategic advisors. They’re not just implementing AI; they’re leveraging it to reshape entire business models. Through the AWS Marketplace, they’re not merely listing solutions; they’re creating new revenue streams and accelerating customer outcomes. And most importantly, they recognize that true innovation doesn’t happen in isolation – they’re forging powerful collaborations within the AWS ecosystem that multiply their impact and reach.

This holistic approach, where each strategic move builds upon and amplifies the others, creates a multiplier effect that delivers extraordinary value to customers while driving unprecedented growth for Partners.
