In today’s digital landscape, operational resilience helps organizations thrive in the face of business disruptions—whether from system outages, infrastructure failures, or unexpected disruptions in service delivery. Organizations that prioritize resilience can turn potential disruptions into opportunities to demonstrate operational excellence.

Building on the AWS Resilience Services Competency [launched at re:Invent 2023](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/improve-the-resilience-posture-of-your-workloads-with-aws-resilience-competency-partners/), we’re excited to expand the AWS Specialization to Software Partners. This expansion brings specialized software solutions designed to support and enhance the resilience of critical workloads in the cloud.

Commitment to operational excellence does more than protect revenue—it strengthens market position through enhanced customer confidence and long-term loyalty. By delivering consistent, reliable experiences organizations can build a foundation for sustainable growth and competitive advantage in today’s demanding market.

In the [AWS Resilience Competency](https://aws.amazon.com/resilience/partners/), Services Partners deliver professional services for design, operation, and recovery of business critical workloads, now complemented by Software Partners who provide purpose-built tools to implement and maintain resilience. These solutions strengthen high system availability, ensuring organizations stay ready to meet customer demands.

## Launch Partner Showcase

AWS Resilience Competency Partners must meet stringent technical and operational requirements, working closely with AWS to deliver comprehensive resilience solutions that help customers achieve availability goals while reducing operational complexity.

AWS Resilience Software Competency Partners are validated by AWS experts across three strategic categories:

- **Resilience Design** — Solutions that ensure high availability through advanced technologies, including proxy, load balancers, service mesh, clustering solutions, and software quality.
- **Resilience Operations** — Solutions that enable continuous resilience at the operational level through observability, chaos engineering, and incident management capabilities.
- **Resilience Recovery** — Solutions focused on disaster recovery that minimize Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) to maintain business continuity.

We invite you to explore the following AWS Resilience Software Launch Partner solutions recommended by AWS:
