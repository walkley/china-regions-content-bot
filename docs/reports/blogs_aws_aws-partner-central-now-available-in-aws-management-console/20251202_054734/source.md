Today, we’re announcing that [AWS Partner Central](https://console.aws.amazon.com/partnercentral/home) is now available directly in the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com), creating a unified experience that transforms how you engage with AWS as both customers and AWS Partners.

As someone who has worked with countless AWS customers over the years, I’ve observed how organizations evolve in their AWS journey. Many of our most successful Partners began as AWS customers—first using our services to build their own infrastructure and solutions, then expanding to create offerings for others. Seeing this natural progression from customer to Partner, we recognized an opportunity to streamline these traditionally separate experiences into one unified journey.

As AWS evolved, so did the needs of our Partner community. Organizations today operate in multiple capacities: using AWS services for their own infrastructure while simultaneously building and delivering solutions for their customers. Modern businesses need streamlined workflows that support their growth from AWS customer to Partner to [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/) Seller, with enterprise-grade security features that match how they actually work with AWS today.

**A new unified console experience** The integration of AWS Partner Central into the Console represents a fundamental shift in partnership accessibility. For existing AWS customers, such as you, becoming an AWS Partner is now as clear as accessing any other AWS service. The familiar console interface provides direct access to partnership opportunities, program benefits, and AWS Marketplace capabilities without needing separate logins or navigation between different systems.

Getting started as an AWS Partner now takes only a few clicks within your existing console environment. You can discover partnership opportunities, understand program requirements, and begin your Partner journey without leaving the AWS interface you already know and trust.

The console integration creates an intuitive pathway for existing customers to transition into AWS Marketplace Sellers. You can now access AWS Marketplace Seller capabilities alongside your existing AWS services, managing both your infrastructure and AWS Marketplace business from a single interface. Private offer requests and negotiations can be managed directly within AWS Partner Central, and you can manage your AWS Marketplace listings alongside your other AWS activities through streamlined workflows.

**Becoming an AWS Partner** The unified console experience provides access to comprehensive partnership benefits designed to accelerate your business growth.

**Join** the [AWS Partner Network (APN)](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/) and complete your Partner and AWS Marketplace Seller requirements seamlessly within the same interface. Enroll in Partner Paths that align with your customer solutions to build, market, list, and sell in AWS Marketplace while growing alongside AWS. When you are established, use the Partner programs to **differentiate** your solution, list in AWS Marketplace to improve your go-to-market discoverability, and build AWS expertise through certifications to drive profitability by capturing new revenue streams. **Scale** your business by selling or reselling software and professional services in AWS Marketplace, helping you accelerate deals, boost revenue, and expand your customer reach to new geographies, industries, and segments.

Throughout your journey, you can continue using [Amazon Q](https://aws.amazon.com/q/) in the console, which provides personalized guidance through AWS Partner Assistant.

**Let’s see the new Partner Central console** The new AWS Partner Central is accessible like any other AWS service from the console. Among many new capabilities, it provides four key sections that support Partner operations and business growth within the AWS Partner Network:

**1. It helps you sell your solutions**

[![AWS Partner Central - Solutions](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/11/12/2025-11-12_14-18-22-1024x532.png)](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/11/12/2025-11-12_14-18-22.png)

You can create and publish solutions that address specific customer needs through AWS Marketplace. Solutions are made up of products such as software as a service (SaaS), Amazon Machine Images (AMI), containers, professional services, AI agents and tools, and more. The solutions management capability guides you through building offerings that include both products you own and those you are authorized to resell. You can craft compelling value propositions and descriptions that clearly communicate your solution benefits to potential buyers browsing AWS Marketplace.

I choose **Create solution** to start listing a new solution in the AWS Marketplace, as shown in the following figure.

**2. It helps you update and manage your Partner profile**

[![AWS Partner Central - Manage profile](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/11/12/2025-11-12_14-30-32-1024x462.png)](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/11/12/2025-11-12_14-30-32.png)

Your Partner profile showcases your organization’s expertise and capabilities to the AWS community. You control how your business appears to potential customers and Partners by highlighting the industry segments you serve and describing your primary products or services. Profile visibility settings provide you with the option to choose whether your information is public or private.

**3. It helps you track opportunities**

[![AWS Partner Central - Track Opportunities](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/11/12/2025-11-12_14-28-32-1024x577.png)](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/11/12/2025-11-12_14-28-32.png)

You can manage your pipeline of AWS customers, supporting joint collaborations with AWS on customer engagements. You monitor these prospects using clear status indicators: approved, rejected, draft, and pending approval. The opportunity dashboard shows stages, estimated AWS Monthly Recurring Revenue, and other key metrics that help you understand your pipeline. You can create more opportunities directly within the console and export data for your own reporting and analysis.

**4. It provides you with the ability to discover and connect with other Partners**

After becoming an AWS Partner, you get access to the AWS Partners network, where you can search for other Partners. You can connect with them to collaborate on sales opportunities and expand your customer outreach.

[![AWS Partner Central - Discover and Search for partners](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/11/12/2025-11-12_14-36-39-1024x677.png)](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/11/12/2025-11-12_14-36-39.png)

You search through available Partners using filters for industry, location, Partner program type, and specialization. The centralized dashboard shows your active connections, pending requests, and connection history, so that you can manage business relationships and identify collaboration opportunities that can expand your reach. Like all other AWS services, these Partner connection capabilities are now available as APIs, which provide automation and integration into your existing workflows.

[![AWS Partner Central - Manage contact requests](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/11/12/2025-11-12_14-36-48-1024x462.png)](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/11/12/2025-11-12_14-36-48.png)

These capabilities work together within the new AWS Partner Central console, accessible directly from the console, helping you transition from AWS customer to successful Partner with enterprise-grade security and streamlined workflows.

**The technical foundation: Migrating the identity system** This unified console experience is made possible by our migration to a modern identity system built on [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/). We’ve transitioned from legacy identity infrastructure to IAM Identity Center, providing enterprise-grade security capabilities including single sign-on capabilities and multi-factor authentication. With security as job zero, this migration provides new and existing Partners with the possibility to connect their own identity providers to AWS Partner Central. It provides seamless integration with existing enterprise authentication systems while removing the complexity of managing separate credentials across different services.

**One more thing** APIs are the core of what we do at AWS, and AWS Partner Central is no different. You can automate and streamline your co-sell workflows by connecting your business tools to AWS Partner Central. [The APIs offered by AWS Partner Central](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/partner-central/latest/APIReference/welcome.html) help you accelerate APN benefits—from Account Management (Account API) and Solution Management (Solution API) to co-selling with Opportunity and Leads APIs, and Benefits APIs for faster benefit activation.

You can use these APIs to engage with AWS and grow your Partner business from your own CRM tools.

**Get started today** This integration between the console and AWS Partner Central reflects our commitment to reducing complexity and improving the Partner experience. We’re bringing AWS Partner Central into the console to create a more intuitive path for organizations to grow with AWS from initial customer adoption through to full partnership engagement and AWS Marketplace success.

Your journey from AWS customer to successful AWS Partner and AWS Marketplace Seller starts with a few clicks in your console. I encourage you to explore the new unified experience today and discover how AWS Partner Central in the console can accelerate your organization’s growth and success within the AWS community.
