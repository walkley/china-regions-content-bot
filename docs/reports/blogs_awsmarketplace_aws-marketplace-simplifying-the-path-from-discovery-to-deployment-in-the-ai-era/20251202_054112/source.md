For more than 13 years, AWS Marketplace has transformed how organizations discover, evaluate, purchase, and manage cloud solutions. With the recent surge in AI applications, customers need even faster, simpler ways to find and deploy solutions that help drive their innovation, and our AWS Partners need new ways to go-to-market and scale their businesses.

At [AWS re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/), we’re introducing a number of new innovations that help simplify discovery and deployment.

## AI-Powered marketplace: Simplifying and accelerating how customers discover and purchase cloud solutions

Earlier this year, we introduced a new generative AI-powered search for [AI Agents and Tools](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/solutions/ai-agents-and-tools) in AWS Marketplace. Customers love the ease of using natural language to discover AI solutions that solve their business challenges. Today, we’re introducing new AI features that help reduce friction in discovery and transactions across AWS Marketplace:

- **Agent mode** — a new conversational discovery experience that’s purpose-built for software procurement, is now accessible on the [AWS Marketplace website](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/agentmode) or through AI applications that support Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. Powered by agents, customers can find solutions using natural language queries based on their use case, as well as use a chat interface to ask follow-up questions. Customers can also request product insights or upload documents to narrow results to those that meet their business and technical requirements. Agent mode allows customers to evaluate solutions side-by-side with a dynamic comparisons table that updates based on their needs. Once customers are ready to buy, they can initiate a purchase or generate a custom purchasing proposal to download and share with internal stakeholders.
- **Express private offers** – a new opt-in capability for Partners that allows customers to automatically receive personalized offers in minutes. AWS Marketplace qualifies customers and automates delivery of custom pricing based on Partner-defined terms. [Express private offers](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/11/aws-marketplace-express-private-offers/) help Partners focus their sales teams on complex deals and help customers complete transactions more quickly.

## Easily discover and purchase pre-packaged multi-product solutions

Business leaders want more than just standalone products – they’re looking for solutions to their complex challenges that can be purchased with cloud-like simplicity. AWS Marketplace now allows Partners to sell packaged [multi-product solutions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/11/introducing-multi-product-solutions-aws-marketplace/) that combine products and services from multiple providers, including those designed to work with [Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-swmfldimompjy) and [Amazon Quick Suite](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-vtz26kzy3sabi), to address specific industry or customer use cases.

We already have more than 60 multi-product solutions in AWS Marketplace that combine software and services from providers such as [Accenture and Elastic](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-vrn6y7vv37wrm), [Presidio and Zscaler](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-7z3lik5lnhwio), [TEKsystems Global Services and Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-cjuazw7xlc6o6), [Deloitte and Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-hiccx2xehxjva), and more. These solutions help address customer use cases such as simplifying complex data operations, making it easier to build AI agents, enabling secure identity-based access to private applications without a VPN, and modernizing financial services contact centers.

These solutions give customers a seamless purchasing experience through one Partner while maintaining the flexibility to negotiate custom pricing and terms for each component. For Partners, this unlocks outcome-based selling and listing comprehensive industry-specific solutions in AWS Marketplace. Most importantly, customers can access the solutions they need with the streamlined procurement they’ve come to expect from AWS Marketplace.

“The evolution of marketplaces is fundamentally changing enterprise software procurement. Instead of buying individual tools, organizations can now use new AI-powered discovery capabilities within marketplaces to assemble intelligent systems that work together seamlessly. AWS Marketplace’s new multi-product solutions, for example, enables organizations to discover and evaluate complete solutions via an intelligent, guided experience. This type of evolution in marketplaces enables enterprises to navigate the agentic AI landscape and discover solutions more easily.” – Tim Law, Research Director, IDC, AI and Automation

## Pricing models that match your business

Customers are increasingly coming to AWS Marketplace not only for SaaS and traditional ISV solutions, but also for professional services and a growing array of AI agent solutions. To support this expansion, AWS Marketplace now offers [variable payment](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/11/marketplace-variable-payments-professional-services/) models for professional services—allowing billing for time-and-materials, milestones, or outcome-driven pricing that aligns costs with delivered value. For AI agents and tools, Partners can now offer both contract-based and usage-based pricing models, allowing them to serve longer-term client engagements. These flexible pricing capabilities help Partners serve a broader set of customer needs and allow customers to get fast access to solutions with business-aligned pricing.

“Having already surpassed $1 billion in lifetime sales through AWS Marketplace, Presidio has seen firsthand how it accelerates customer acquisition and deal velocity for our professional services. The new AWS Marketplace capabilities, including variable billing, give customers the flexibility, transparency, and control they want over how they consume technology and services. These innovations let customers align costs with actual usage and adapt as their needs evolve, while enabling Presidio to deliver greater value and tailored solutions even more efficiently through the AWS Marketplace.” – Kevin Corace, Senior Vice President, Software and Services Lifecycle at Presidio

## Accelerating time-to-value with rapid deployment

Customers deploying solutions through AWS Marketplace experience 30% faster time-to-market compared to traditional go-to-market methods. We already allow customers to discover Partner products in 18 AWS service consoles, making solutions accessible where customers are already working. Once you discover what you need and subscribe, we’re making it easier to set up solutions with SaaS Quick Launch, and through guided experiences available for [Databricks](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/streamlined-deployment-experience-databricks-aws/) and now [CrowdStrike](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/11/automated-integration-crowdstrike-falcon-next-gen/). To further accelerate deployment, we’ve launched [IAM temporary delegation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/streamline-customer-onboarding-and-accelerate-time-to-value-with-aws-iam-temporary-delegation/), a new capability that enables Partners to offer streamlined onboarding and management experiences for products that integrate with customers’ AWS accounts. Partners can automate secure resource deployment while customers maintain complete control and visibility over access and actions, simplifying complex setup processes and reducing deployment friction.

## Conclusion

By simplifying every step from discovery to deployment, AWS Marketplace helps customers focus on innovation rather than procurement complexity, enabling them to seize AI opportunities quickly while empowering Partners to scale their businesses efficiently in this transformative era.
