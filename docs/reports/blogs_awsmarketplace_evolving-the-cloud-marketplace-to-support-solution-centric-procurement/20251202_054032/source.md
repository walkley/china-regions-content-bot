[AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/) has evolved to support solution-centric procurement, combining the simplicity of buying through a cloud marketplace with comprehensive business solutions. Today’s business leaders aren’t only looking for individual products, they’re seeking solutions that directly address their complex business challenges. They want to move faster—quickly finding, purchasing, and deploying solutions with the same ease they’ve come to expect from using AWS Marketplace. To meet this demand, [AWS Partners](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/) need a procurement channel that delivers the streamlined experience their customers expect. That’s why AWS Marketplace now offers multi-product solutions—a new capability that Partners can use to combine multiple products and services into comprehensive solutions tailored to specific industries and customer use cases. This gives customers access to end-to-end solutions, all with the simplified procurement benefits of AWS Marketplace.

This post explores the value of solution-centric selling for Partners in AWS Marketplace and how customers can streamline their solution discovery and procurement. With over 50 multi-product solutions in AWS Marketplace today, Partners will learn how [independent software vendors (ISVs)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/independent-software-vendor/), [Channel Partners](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/channel-partners?aws-marketplace-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortOrder&aws-marketplace-cards.sort-order=asc&awsf.aws-marketplace-mscp=*all), system integrators, and distributors have already created innovative solutions that customers can start exploring today.

## Unlock solution selling in AWS Marketplace

With multi-product solutions, Partners can now implement vertical expertise and outcome-driven selling in AWS Marketplace. Partners can offer vertical-specific solutions that address unique industry challenges while meeting regulatory requirements and best practices. This focus on verticals means that Partners can market the business outcomes that appeal to their target audience in AWS Marketplace, whether that’s reducing security incidents or accelerating AI time-to-market. This makes it easier for decision-makers to align technology investments with strategic objectives. This approach shifts the conversation from “what we sell” to “what problems we solve,” positioning Partners as strategic advisors who understand both technical issues and business context.

Partners can deepen and diversify their portfolio by combining their own capabilities with products and services they’re authorized to resell in AWS Marketplace. Using this flexibility, Partners can create differentiated solutions that harness their unique strengths and existing relationships, building more strategic, value-driven customer relationships. The addition of AWS services in AWS Marketplace expands possibilities for Partners, whereby they can offer comprehensive solutions that are designed to work with [Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-swmfldimompjy) and [Amazon Quick Suite](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-vtz26kzy3sabi).

## Streamlined solution discovery and procurement for customers

On the solution detail page, customers can evaluate how the solution addresses their specific business needs.

The solution is marked as a multi-product offering with 3 of 4 products deployed on AWS.](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/761f22b2c1593d0bb87e0b606f990ba4974706de/2025/11/28/MPS_1.png)

Customers can also scroll down the page to learn more about each component in the solution. If interested, customers can scroll to the top of the page and request a private offer to start a discussion with the Partner.

Customers work with a single Partner throughout the procurement process, simplifying negotiations by having one point of contact.

Customers can negotiate pricing and terms for each component individually while benefiting from a streamlined approval process, purchase order assignment, and total cost assessment for the solution. For solutions with professional services, customers can request to be billed based on outcomes, time and materials, or project milestones.

As a result, customers can manage individual components separately, including independent renewals and amendments.

## Multi-product solutions in action

We’re already seeing Partners innovate across diverse use cases, from zero-trust security solutions that simplify secure application access to generative AI transformation solutions that turn your data into useful AI insights. In the following examples, we showcase how different types of Partners can use multi-product solutions, including real cases that demonstrate successful implementations across various industries.

**ISVs** can combine their own products and services. Okta, the leading independent identity partner, packaged their software and professional services to offer a [comprehensive security solution](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ybjvxmpy3ykha) in AWS Marketplace. “With multi-product solutions, we can provide both the requisite software and critical deployment services within a single listing, offering a more streamlined procurement and purchasing experience for our customers,” said Josh Greene, Area VP of Cloud Alliances at Okta. “This new capability will help our teams deliver an immediate, fully configured platform that provides robust security for any application being deployed in an AWS environment.”

**Channel Partners** can combine their services with ISV products they’re authorized to resell. SCC, a leader in workplace transformation and exceptional customer experiences, combined SCC services with products from CrowdStrike into a tailored solution for customers to reduce risk and safeguard their business. The [MDR Managed Service](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-deo6u5zyvb3rk) provides 24/7 endpoint detection and response, blending advanced technology with expert analysts to deliver proactive threat monitoring, rapid incident response, and end-to-end visibility. “Offering a multi-product solution through AWS Marketplace allows us to deliver packaged solutions globally, while simplifying procurement and addressing specific customer needs across regions through AWS Marketplace.” Jean-Philippe Barleaza – EMEA Head of Software, SCC

**System integrators** can combine software and services from one or more Partners. Accenture, a leading global professional services company, now combines Accenture services and Elastic products into a single solution in AWS Marketplace, streamlining discovery and procurement for their customers. [The Data Readiness Engine for Gen AI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-vrn6y7vv37wrm) provides secure vectorization and advanced search, integrating Elasticsearch with Accenture Aspire Connectors and professional services to accelerate AI innovation. “As AI moves out of proof of concept into production, companies are asking for ways to prepare their proprietary data at scale. With multi-product solutions in AWS Marketplace, we can combine Accenture’s industry solutions and proven enterprise connectors with Elastic’s powerful AI search capabilities, helping organizations transform enterprise data into AI-ready context that drives meaningful business outcomes.” – Teresa Tung, Global Data Lead, Accenture

**Distributors** can combine multiple ISV products they list and manage into a multi-product solution. Westcon-Comstor*,* a distributor specializing in cybersecurity, networking, and cloud, focuses on bringing solutions to market as an orchestrator between multiple ISVs and building solutions that can solve wider customer challenges. [Westcon’s Z-Strike solution](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-yokhii5i7xgcc) delivers total security from endpoint to cloud by combining products from two well-known ISVs, CrowdStrike and Zscaler, with Westcon-Comstor Professional Services to support the implementation. “As a cybersecurity specialist distributor, we sell solutions instead of products, so having a multi-product solution available in AWS Marketplace is a natural extension of our AWS go-to-market strategy.” Peter Woest – AWS Marketplace ISV & Alliances Director EMEA

**Partners** can list multi-product solutions that are designed to work with AWS services, including Amazon Connect and Amazon Quick Suite. TEKsystems Global Services, a leading provider of business and technology services, has combined AMPGS® Reimagine CX and AMPGS® Intelligent Document Processing and other technology services to deliver a multi-product solution through AWS Marketplace that is designed to work with Amazon Connect. [This solution](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-fv67i2pp7tnhw) helps organizations across commercial and public sectors modernize contact center operations with automation, scalability, and AI-driven intelligence, simplifying procurement and accelerating adoption. “By offering a multi-product solution, we are reinforcing our commitment to delivering innovative, scalable solutions,” said Mike Driscoll, Director of Global Alliances, TEKsystems Global Services. “Through AWS Marketplace, we unite AMPGS® Reimagine CX and AMPGS® Intelligent Document Processing into one solution, helping organizations achieve deep customization, scalability, and intelligence for highly adaptable, AI-enhanced, customer-focused contact centers.”
