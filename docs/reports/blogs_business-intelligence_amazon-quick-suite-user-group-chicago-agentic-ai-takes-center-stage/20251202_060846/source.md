The [Amazon Quick Suite User Group – Chicago](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13200185/) is a local community of [Amazon Quick Suite](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksuite/) users based in the Chicago area who come together quarterly to share knowledge, best practices, and experiences with the platform. These User Groups typically serve as collaborative forums where members can:

- **Learn and Share**: Exchange inspiration and learnings about Quick Suite, including how to create custom agents and how to leverage unified AI agents for research, business insights and automation.
- **Network**: Connect with other professionals in the region who are using Quick Suite for enterprise AI applications, data analytics, and workplace productivity.
- **Problem-Solve**: Discuss challenges, solutions, and innovative use cases for leveraging Quick Suite’s capabilities across different business contexts.
- **Stay Updated**: Learn about new features, updates, and best practices directly from peers and experts.
- **Build Community**: Foster a local support network that complements the broader Quick Suite ecosystem.

User Groups like this provide valuable peer-to-peer learning opportunities and help organizations maximize their investment in the Amazon Quick Suite platform through shared expertise and collaborative problem-solving within a specific geographic community.

In this post, we’re excited to share highlights from the second Chicago Amazon Quick Suite User Group meetup. We had over 90 innovators attend the event and the energy around agentic AI and what Amazon Quick Suite can do was incredible!

## Real-world agentic AI impact

[Amazon Quick Suite](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksuite/) helps business users make better decisions faster and act on them by unifying AI agents for research, business insights, and automation into a single experience – all while maintaining security and user access policies. Business users of any skill level can find answers across relevant data sources in minutes instead of days, analyze data through natural language, create sophisticated visualizations, immediately act on insights without switching tools, and automate any task. At the heart of these enhancements is the unification of structured and unstructured data sources, driving its [powerful new capabilities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksuite/latest/userguide/what-is.html).

The power of agentic AI lies in its ability to understand context and act across systems — surfacing insights, automating workflows, and executing tasks with appropriate oversight to help you work smarter. At our Chicago User Group, we explored how Quick Suite’s AI agents can:

- Intelligently search and synthesize information across multiple data sources, providing contextual answers that would traditionally require manual research across various systems
- Automate complex workflows through Quick Flows, turning repetitive multi-step processes into streamlined, AI-powered automations
- Personalize user experiences by learning from interaction patterns and adapting responses to individual needs and preferences
- Act alongside human decision-making, not just providing recommendations but executing approved tasks and updates

AI agents can dynamically adjust dashboard views, highlight critical metrics based on user roles and current business context, and proactively surface insights that matter most at any given moment. This shift from static, one-size-fits-all dashboards to intelligent, adaptive interfaces represents a fundamental change in how we work with data.

Our Chicago community is particularly excited about applying these concepts to their own use cases, from automating customer research workflows to building custom agents that understand industry-specific terminology and business processes. The conversations at our meetup revealed that organizations are moving beyond simple chatbots to truly agentic systems that can plan and act—transforming productivity across teams.

*Attendees learn how Quick Suite helps teams get the right answers and act quickly with the help of AI agents.*

The leadership team is what makes it all happen—they bring individual Quick Suite enthusiasts and innovators into a [global connected community](https://community.amazonquicksight.com/) through thoughtfully planned meetups, technical deep-dives, and networking opportunities that drive real value for Chicago-area professionals.

The numbers speak for themselves—our attendees rated this meetup a 4.86 out of 5! This score reflects not just the quality of the content, but the genuine value our community finds in exploring agentic AI technology together.
