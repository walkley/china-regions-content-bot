Organizations are increasingly seeking to enhance customer experiences through natural, responsive voice interactions across their telephony systems. [Amazon Nova Sonic](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/speech/) addresses this need as a speech-to-speech generative AI model that delivers real-time voice conversations with low latency and natural turn-taking. It understands speech across different accents and speaking styles, responds with expressive voices in multiple languages, and handles interruptions gracefully. Available through the [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) bidirectional streaming API, Nova Sonic can connect to your business data and external tools and can be integrated directly with telephony systems.

The speech modality makes Amazon Nova Sonic naturally well-suited for telephony applications where preserving conversational nuances and minimizing latency are critical. Nova Sonic is ideal for use cases like automated call centers that need human-like interactions, proactive phone call outreach campaigns, and AI receptionist use cases.

To integrate Amazon Nova Sonic with your telephony architecture, you will need an application server to connect and maintain a persistent bidirectional streaming connection to Nova Sonic. This post will introduce sample implementations for the most common telephony scenarios: Direct Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) integration with traditional phone infrastructure, direct integration with telephony providers like [Vonage](https://www.vonage.com/?bypassgeoloc=true), [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us), and [Genesys](https://www.genesys.com/), and open source frameworks for building telephony applications, like [Pipecat](https://www.pipecat.ai/) and [LiveKit](https://livekit.io/). These approaches cover the spectrum from legacy PBX systems to modern cloud communications, giving you multiple paths to connect Nova Sonic with phone networks.

## Common Amazon Nova Sonic telephony use cases

Nova Sonic can be used for these common telephony use cases:

- **Call center operations**: Amazon Nova Sonic can handle customer service calls, technical support inquiries, and routine transactions through natural conversation, operating as the primary agent for inbound calls. It can also replace traditional IVR systems so customers can describe their needs instead of navigating phone menus. For high-volume periods, it can manage overflow calls and escalates complex issues to human agents with full conversation summaries.
- **Receptionist and outreach functions**: Amazon Nova Sonic can connect to company systems like CRMs and calendars to handle scheduling, answer company questions, and route calls based on conversation content. For outbound use cases, it can conduct appointment reminders with rescheduling capabilities, follow-up calls for feedback collection, and survey campaigns. The speech-to-speech design maintains natural conversation flow while accessing real-time data to personalize interactions based on customer history.

## Amazon Nova Sonic SIP integrations

Integrating Amazon Nova Sonic with Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) infrastructure requires an application server that serves as an intermediary layer. This server manages both SIP signaling and Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) media streams, while maintaining the connection to the Nova Sonic bidirectional streaming API. The server bridges your existing telephony infrastructure with Nova Sonic to handle call session management and audio routing between both systems.

There are two sample implementations: a [Java-based SIP gateway](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-s2s-voip-gateway) using the mjSIP stack and AWS SDK for Java, and a [JavaScript SIP server](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-sonic-sip-server-js) using Node.js with SIP.js and the AWS SDK for JavaScript. Both samples demonstrate the same core architecture with language-specific implementations.

The core components include a SIP stack for call control signaling, an RTP handler for audio stream processing, and an Amazon Nova Sonic client that maintains persistent connections to Amazon Bedrock. When an inbound call arrives, the SIP Server answers via SIP, establishes RTP media sessions, and creates a corresponding Sonic streaming session. Audio flows bidirectionally:

- RTP packets from the caller are decoded, converted to the appropriate audio format, and streamed to Nova Sonic
- The Nova Sonic audio responses are encoded and transmitted back via RTP

For deployment, you can run the SIP Servers on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances with proper security group configuration for SIP signaling (port 5060) and RTP media streams (typically ports 10000-20000), or deploy containerized using Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with host networking mode to access the required UDP port ranges. Both approaches:

- Require IAM permissions for Amazon Bedrock access and proper credential management.
- Support seamless integration with PBX systems, VoIP providers (like Vonage), or traditional telephony networks when you configure your existing telephony infrastructure to route calls to the gateway’s public endpoint

## Integrations with telephony providers

Cloud telephony providers like Vonage, Twilio, Genesys, and Amazon Connect offer managed voice services that handle the complexity of traditional telephony infrastructure through simple APIs. Unlike direct SIP integration, these providers abstract the underlying protocols and offer features like global phone number provisioning, automatic failover, call analytics, and compliance capabilities.

### Vonage

Vonage is a cloud communications platform that provides voice, messaging, and video APIs for businesses. An Amazon Nova Sonic integration with Vonage was announced in July 2025, providing a direct path to connect phone calls to conversational AI through the Vonage Voice API. With this integration businesses can deploy real-time voice agents across telephony channels without managing complex telephony infrastructure, as Vonage handles call routing, audio streaming, and protocol translation. The integration works by configuring Vonage webhooks that trigger when calls are received or initiated. Your application server receives these webhook events, establishes a Nova Sonic streaming session, and creates a bidirectional audio bridge between the Vonage call and Nova Sonic. Vonage manages the telephony complexities including codec conversion and network transport, while your server handles the AI conversation flow and connects to your business systems and data sources.

For detailed implementation guidance, see the [Deploy conversational agents with Vonage and Amazon Nova Sonic](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/deploy-conversational-agents-with-vonage-and-amazon-nova-sonic/) blog post and the [sample implementation](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-sonic-contact-center-with-vonage/tree/main) in the aws-samples GitHub repository.

### Twilio

Twilio is a cloud-based customer engagement platform that offers voice, SMS, email, and video capabilities. It provides APIs and SDKs for developers to build custom communication solutions, automate messaging, and implement real-time notifications. This platform serves as the foundation for businesses to create and manage their customer communications efficiently. Twilio integrates with AWS to combine communication expertise with cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities. The integration works through webhook-based event processing, real-time media streaming via WebSocket connections. When calls are received or initiated, Twilio webhooks trigger events that the customer’s application server receives. The server then establishes an Amazon Nova Sonic streaming session and creates a media streaming connection for real-time audio processing between Twilio calls and the application server. Twilio handles communication complexities like codec conversion and network transport, while Sonic handles the natural language conversation. This integration enables businesses to deploy AI-powered voice agents, implement predictive analytics, and create personalized customer experiences using comprehensive customer data across both Twilio and AWS.

For detailed implementation guidance, see the [sample implementation](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-amazon-nova-sonic-twilio-integration) in the aws-samples GitHub repository.
