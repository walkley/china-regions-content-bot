# Register now: Exam update and new name for cloud operations certification

by Lauren Ebbin on 15 JUL 2025 in [Announcements](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/category/post-types/announcements/ "View all posts in Announcements"), [AWS Training and Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/category/aws-training-and-certification/ "View all posts in AWS Training and Certification"), [DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/category/devops/ "View all posts in DevOps") [Permalink](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/exam-update-and-new-name-for-operations-certification/) Share

*Edited on September 9, 2025, to note registration is now open and to include new exam preparation resources, available on AWS Skill Builder.*

Registration is now open for the [AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer – Associate](http://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloudops-engineer-associate) exam (formerly known as [AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/)) to align with the latest skills and knowledge in monitoring and maintaining [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) workloads. The last day to take the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate (SOA-C02) will be September 29, 2025.

## From SysOps to CloudOps

We’re renaming this certification as AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer – Associate to reflect the evolving nature of cloud operations and a shift in industry terminology. This change is intended to enhance the relevancy and credibility of individuals who earn this certification, highlighting their knowledge and skills in deploying, operating, and maintaining workloads on AWS.

## From SOA-C02 to SOA-C03

We’ve updated the exam with the help of our subject matter experts (SMEs) and will release the new exam guide on September 9, 2025. A key difference between the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate (SOA-C02) and AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer – Associate (SOA-C03) is that containers are now in scope for SOA-C03. We’ve included more modern services and features, a greater emphasis on multi-account, multi-Region architectures, and more on automation and [infrastructure as code](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/iac/). No task statements were removed between exam versions, but the new content outline is more detailed with some reorganization of task statements.

## Certification maintenance and badges

The name change to AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer – Associate will only apply to those who pass the SOA-C03. It won’t be retroactively changed for those who hold the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate. Here’s what you need to know about certification validity, recertification, and maintaining certified status:

* **Individuals who have earned the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate certification** aren’t required to earn the AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer – Associate. They can continue displaying their certification badge, which will remain active until its expiration date.
* **Individuals who have earned the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate certification and then earn the AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer – Associate** will have a separate badge for each certification. Their AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate certification will remain active until its expiration date. Going forward, these individuals can either:
  + Continue to recertify the AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer – Associate certification by passing the latest version of the exam
  + Recertify both certifications by upgrading to the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional certification before the certifications’ expiration date.
* **Individuals who have an active AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional and AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate** certification can continue to recertify both certifications by passing the latest version of the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional exam.
