by Veda Raman, Kishor Aher, and Rahul Sharma on 01 AUG 2025 in [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/artificial-intelligence/amazon-machine-learning/amazon-bedrock/ "View all posts in Amazon Bedrock"), [Amazon Machine Learning](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/artificial-intelligence/amazon-machine-learning/ "View all posts in Amazon Machine Learning"), [Announcements](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/post-types/announcements/ "View all posts in Announcements"), [Artificial Intelligence](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/artificial-intelligence/ "View all posts in Artificial Intelligence") [Permalink](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-bedrock-agentcore-browser-tool/)  [Comments](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-bedrock-agentcore-browser-tool/#Comments)  Share

At AWS Summit New York City 2025, [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS) announced the preview of [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/?trk=e61dee65-4ce8-4738-84db-75305c9cd4fe&sc_channel=el) browser tool, a fully managed, pre-built cloud-based browser. This tool enables [generative AI](https://aws.amazon.com/generative-ai/) agents to interact seamlessly with websites. It addresses two fundamental limitations: first, [foundation models](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/foundation-models/) (FMs) are trained on large but static datasets and need dynamic access to current information when API access isn’t readily available; second, organizations face significant challenges when attempting to scale web automation with AI for enterprise use cases.

The development of agentic AI systems is moving toward applications that can execute complex, multistep tasks. For these agents to be effective, they require access to dynamic, real-time data, particularly from websites and web applications that don’t offer APIs or where API integration would be complex. Moreover, as businesses seek to deploy AI-powered automation across their operations, they need solutions that can reliably scale without the operational overhead of managing browser farms or solving complex concurrency issues. The AgentCore Browser Tool provides these capabilities, allowing agents to perform tasks such as automating research, streamlining operations, and interacting with web-based applications—all with the scalability, reliability, and security of the AWS Cloud infrastructure. By providing a fully managed cloud-based browser, AWS addresses the critical need for enterprises to deploy AI automation at scale across thousands of concurrent sessions, supporting use cases from customer service automation to large-scale data collection and analysis, without the traditional complexity and resource constraints of self-managed browser automation frameworks.

In this post, we introduce the newly announced Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser Tool. We explore why organizations need cloud-based browser automation and the limitations it addresses for FMs that require real-time data access. We talk about key use cases and the core capabilities of the AgentCore Browser Tool. We walk through how to get started with the tool.

## Why do you need the cloud-based AgentCore Browser Tool?

Traditional browser automation approaches have typically required significant infrastructure management, security considerations, and development expertise. The introduction of a fully managed, cloud-based browser automation solution addresses several critical needs, including simplified infrastructure management, enterprise-grade security, global availability and scaling, and cost optimization. Organizations no longer need to provision, maintain, and scale browser instances to support their automation needs. AWS now handles the complex infrastructure requirements, so developers can focus on building intelligent agent capabilities rather than managing browser farms. Cloud-based browser automation provides isolated execution environments with AWS security controls, reducing the risk of data exfiltration or unauthorized access that might occur in less controlled environments. With a cloud-based browser, you can instantaneously deploy browser instances across the global infrastructure of AWS so that browser automation can scale. By offering browser automation as a managed service, organizations can use a consumption-based pricing model instead of maintaining always-on infrastructure, which can substantially reduce costs for intermittent workloads.

## Use cases for cloud-based browser automation

**Handling repetitive web tasks**: With the introduction of Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser Tool, organizations can now implement sophisticated browser automation at scale. Cloud-based browser automation excels at minimizing manual execution of repetitive tasks across web interfaces. AI agents can populate complex web forms across multiple systems, validate entries, and maintain compliance with business rules. Agents can navigate to internal dashboards, extract critical metrics, and compile reports without human intervention. For organizations managing large user-generated content domains, agents can assist human moderators by prescreening content across multiple web interfaces.

**AI powered research and intelligence gathering**: With cloud-based browser automation, AI agents become powerful research assistants. They automatically track related websites for pricing changes, new product launches, or content updates with regular monitoring. You can use AI agents to gather and analyze consumer sentiment across various web forums, review sites, and social domains to inform product development. With the AgentCore Browser Tool, you can create automated systems that regularly scan trusted information sources to keep internal knowledge bases current.

**Complex workflow automation across systems**: Many organizations operate across numerous web applications that lack integrated workflows. Use the AgentCore Browser Tool to automate customer setup across multiple software-as-a-service (SaaS) systems when APIs are unavailable. This helps maintain consistency and reduces error rates. You can monitor supplier portals, inventory systems, and logistics services to maintain visibility across complex supply chains. By automating account creation and permission settings across numerous internal web applications, employee onboarding becomes streamlined.

**Testing and quality assurance:** Cloud-based browser automation enables robust testing at scale. You can use AgentCore Browser Tool to validate user experiences and functionality across different scenarios, devices, and browsers in parallel. Deploy agents to continuously interact with critical business applications and set up alerts to your teams about performance issues before customers encounter them. With AgentCore Browser Tool, you can regularly test web applications for accessibility compliance, security vulnerabilities, or regulatory requirements.

**Legacy system integration**: Many organizations maintain legacy systems that lack modern APIs. Enable modern AI capabilities to interact with legacy web applications that would be costly to replace or modernize. Apply intelligent automation to systems that were never designed for programmatic access. As a result, you can extract valuable organizational data trapped in older web applications through regular, automated harvesting.

## How an AI agent can use AgentCore Browser Tool

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser runs in a secure, isolated containerized environment within AgentCore, insulating web activity from your local system. You can interact with the AgentCore Browser Tool using browser actuation libraries, such as Playwright, or use AI agentic frameworks specialized for browser automation, such as [Amazon Nova Act](https://nova.amazon.com/act) and Browser Use. You can also integrate browser automation as a tool in a multi-agentic workflow.

Amazon Nova Act or Browser Use works with the AgentCore Browser Tool to take natural language instructions from the user and convert them to actuations on the browser by following this workflow:

1. The user sends a query such as “search for shoes on Amazon”
2. An agentic framework such as Amazon Nova Act or Browser Use passes the query to the [large language model](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/large-language-model/) (LLM)
3. The LLM reasons and generates instructions in a structured output format (for example, JSON encoded)
4. The agentic framework maps these instructions into browser actuation commands (such as Playwright, Puppeteer, or Selenium)
5. The browser actuation commands are executed on the AgentCore Browser over a secure WebSocket connection
6. The response from the browser and a screenshot are sent to the agent to reason further

This process repeats until the original task is complete. The flow is illustrated in the following diagram.

To use the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Brower Tool, you need to complete the following prerequisites:

* Python 3.10+
* Verify your IAM user or role has the [permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/browser-resource-session-management.html) to use AgentCore Browser:

```
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-bedrock-agentcore-samples.git
pip install bedrock-agentcore
```

For browser visualization on your local machine, you need the `BrowserViewerServer` component in the repository you cloned at: `01-tutorials/05-AgentCore-tools/02-Agent-Core-browser-tool/interactive_tools`

You can also visualize the browser live on the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore console at <https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/builtInTools>

The following Python code demonstrates how to use the AgentCore Browser Tool directly with the Playwright library and the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore SDK. This example initiates a secure browser session, connects to it, and automates a straightforward workflow in which it navigates to <https://www.amazon.com> and searches for a product.

1. To get started with playwright:

```
cd 01-tutorials/05-AgentCore-tools/02-Agent-Core-browser-tool
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
pip install playwright
```

3. Author your playwright-based script:

```
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, Playwright, BrowserType
from bedrock_agentcore.tools.browser_client import browser_session
from browser_viewer import BrowserViewerServer
import time
from rich.console import Console
console = Console()
def run(playwright: Playwright):
    # Create the browser session and keep it alive
    with browser_session('us-west-2') as client:
        ws_url, headers = client.generate_ws_headers()
        # Start viewer server
        viewer = BrowserViewerServer(client, port=8005)
        viewer_url = viewer.start(open_browser=True)
        # Connect using headers
        chromium: BrowserType = playwright.chromium
        browser = chromium.connect_over_cdp(
            ws_url,
            headers=headers
        )
        context = browser.contexts[0]
        page = context.pages[0]
        try:
            page.goto("https://amazon.com/")
            console.print(page.title())
            # Keep running
            while True:
                time.sleep(120)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            console.print("\n\n[yellow]Shutting down...[/yellow]")
            if 'client' in locals():
                client.stop()
                console.print("✅ Browser session terminated")
        except Exception as e:
            console.print(f"\n[red]Error: {e}[/red]")
            import traceback
            traceback.print_exc()
with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)
```

Alternatively**,** you can build a browser agent using Amazon Nova Act to automate web interactions:

4. Sign up for Nova Act at <https://nova.amazon.com/act> and generate an API key.
5. In the same Python virtual environment:

```
pip install nova-act
```

6. Author your Nova Act based script:

```
import time
from bedrock_agentcore.tools.browser_client import browser_session
from nova_act import NovaAct
from rich.console import Console
from browser_viewer import BrowserViewerServer

NOVA_ACT_API_KEY = "YOUR_NOVA_ACT_API_KEY"
console = Console()

def main():
    try:
        # Step 1: Create browser session
        with browser_session('us-west-2') as client:
            print("\r   ✅ Browser ready!                    ")
            ws_url, headers = client.generate_ws_headers()

            # Step 2: Start viewer server
            console.print("\n[cyan]Step 3: Starting viewer server...[/cyan]")
            viewer = BrowserViewerServer(client, port=8005)
            viewer_url = viewer.start(open_browser=True)

            # Step 3: Use Nova Act to interact with the browser with NovaAct
            with NovaAct(
                    cdp_endpoint_url=ws_url,
                    cdp_headers=headers,
                    preview={"playwright_actuation": True},
                    nova_act_api_key=NOVA_ACT_API_KEY,
                    starting_page="https://www.amazon.com",
                ) as nova_act:
                    result = nova_act.act("Search for coffee maker and get the details of the lowest priced one on the first page")
                    console.print(f"\n[bold green]Nova Act Result:[/bold green] {result}")

            # Keep running
            while True:
                time.sleep(1)

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        console.print("\n\n[yellow]Shutting down...[/yellow]")
        if 'client' in locals():
            client.stop()
            print("✅ Browser session terminated")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\n[red]Error: {e}[/red]")
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
