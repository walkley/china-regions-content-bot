We’re excited to announce the open source release of [AWS MCP Servers for code assistants](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/) — a suite of specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that bring [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS) best practices directly to your development workflow. Our specialized AWS MCP servers combine deep AWS knowledge with agentic AI capabilities to accelerate development across key areas. Each AWS MCP Server focuses on a specific domain of AWS best practices, working together to provide comprehensive guidance throughout your development journey.

This post is the first in a series covering AWS MCP Servers. In this post, we walk through how these specialized MCP servers can dramatically reduce your development time while incorporating security controls, cost optimizations, and [AWS Well-Architected](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) best practices into your code. Whether you’re an experienced AWS developer or just getting started with cloud development, you’ll discover how to use AI-powered coding assistants to tackle common challenges such as complex service configurations, infrastructure as code (IaC) implementation, and knowledge base integration. By the end of this post, you’ll understand how to start using AWS MCP Servers to transform your development workflow and deliver better solutions, faster.

If you want to get started right away, skip ahead to the section “From Concept to working code in minutes.”

AI is transforming how we build software, creating opportunities to dramatically accelerate development while improving code quality and consistency. Today’s AI assistants can understand complex requirements, generate production-ready code, and help developers navigate technical challenges in real time. This AI-driven approach is particularly valuable in cloud development, where developers need to orchestrate multiple services while maintaining security, scalability, and cost-efficiency.

Developers need code assistants that understand the nuances of AWS services and best practices. Specialized AI agents can address these needs by:

* Providing contextual guidance on AWS service selection and configuration
* Optimizing compliance with security best practices and regulatory requirements
* Promoting the most efficient utilization and cost-effective solutions
* Automating repetitive implementation tasks with AWS specific patterns

This approach means developers can focus on innovation while AI assistants handle the undifferentiated heavy lifting of coding. Whether you’re using [Amazon Q](https://aws.amazon.com/q/), [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), or other AI tools in your workflow, AWS MCP Servers complement and enhance these capabilities with deep AWS specific knowledge to help you build better solutions faster.

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized open protocol that enables seamless interaction between [large language models](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/large-language-model/) (LLMs), data sources, and tools. This protocol allows AI assistants to use specialized tooling and to access domain-specific knowledge by extending the model’s capabilities beyond its built-in knowledge—all while keeping sensitive data local. Through MCP, general-purpose LLMs can now seamlessly access relevant knowledge beyond initial training data and be effectively steered towards desired outputs by incorporating specific context and best practices.

## **Accelerate building on AWS**

What if your AI assistant could instantly access deep AWS knowledge, understanding every AWS service, best practice, and architectural pattern? With MCP, we can transform general-purpose LLMs into AWS specialists by connecting them to specialized knowledge servers. This opens up exciting new possibilities for accelerating cloud development while maintaining security and following best practices.

Build on AWS in a fraction of the time, with best practices automatically applied from the first line of code. Skip hours of documentation research and immediately access ready-to-use patterns for complex services such as [Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/). Our MCP Servers will help you write well-architected code from the start, implement AWS services correctly the first time, and deploy solutions that are secure, observable, and cost-optimized by design. Transform how you build on AWS today.

* **Enforce AWS best practices automatically** – Write well-architected code from the start with built-in security controls, proper observability, and optimized resource configurations
* **Cut research time dramatically** – Stop spending hours reading documentation. Our MCP Servers provide contextually relevant guidance for implementing AWS services correctly, addressing common pitfalls automatically
* **Access ready-to-use patterns instantly** – Use pre-built AWS CDK constructs, [Amazon Bedrock Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/) schema generators, and Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases integration templates that follow AWS best practices from the start
* **Optimize cost proactively** – Prevent over-provisioning as you design your solution by getting cost-optimization recommendations and generating a comprehensive cost report to analyze your AWS spending before deployment

To turn this vision into reality and make AWS development faster, more secure, and more efficient, we’ve created AWS MCP Servers—a suite of specialized AWS MCP Servers that bring AWS best practices directly to your development workflow. Our specialized AWS MCP Servers combine deep AWS knowledge with AI capabilities to accelerate development across key areas. Each AWS MCP Server focuses on a specific domain of AWS best practices, working together to provide comprehensive guidance throughout your development journey.

## Overview of domain-specific MCP Servers for AWS development

Our specialized MCP Servers are designed to cover distinct aspects of AWS development, each bringing deep knowledge to specific domains while working in concert to deliver comprehensive solutions:

* **Core** – The foundation server that provides AI processing pipeline capabilities and serves as a central coordinator. It helps provide clear plans for building AWS solutions and can federate to other MCP servers as needed.

## AWS MCP Servers in action

Here’s how AWS MCP servers transform the development experience:

**Developer:** “I need to build an AI-powered chatbot using Amazon Bedrock that can answer questions from our company’s knowledge base.”

**Core:** “I’ll help you build an Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases chatbot. Let’s create an architecture that uses Amazon Bedrock Agents with a custom action group to call your internal API.”

Core generates a comprehensive architecture diagram showing the knowledge base integration, Amazon Bedrock Agents configuration with action groups, API connectivity, and data flow between components.

**AWS CDK:** “Here’s the infrastructure code for your chatbot with the Amazon Bedrock Agents action group. I’ve included proper IAM roles, security controls, and [Powertools for AWS Lambda](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/python/latest/) for observability.”

```
// CDK code
    const kb = new bedrock.VectorKnowledgeBase(this, 'KB', {
      embeddingsModel: bedrock.BedrockFoundationModel.TITAN_EMBED_TEXT_V2_1024,
      instruction: 'Use this knowledge base to answer questions about books. ' +
        'It contains the full text of novels. Please quote the books to explain your answers.',
    });

    const dataSource = new bedrock.S3DataSource(this, 'DataSource', {
      bucket: docBucket,
      knowledgeBase: kb,
      dataSourceName: 'books',
      chunkingStrategy: bedrock.ChunkingStrategy.fixedSize({
        maxTokens: 500,
        overlapPercentage: 20
      }),
    });

    const agent = new bedrock.Agent(this, 'Agent', {
      foundationModel: bedrock.BedrockFoundationModel.ANTHROPIC_CLAUDE_3_5_SONNET_V2_0,
      instruction: 'You are a helpful and friendly agent that answers questions about literature.',
      knowledgeBases: [kb],
      userInputEnabled: true,
      shouldPrepareAgent:true
    });

    const actionGroupFunction = new lambda_python.PythonFunction(this, 'ActionGroupFunction', {
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.PYTHON_3_12,
      entry: path.join(__dirname, '../lambda/action-group'),
      layers: [lambda.LayerVersion.fromLayerVersionArn(this, 'PowerToolsLayer', `arn:aws:lambda:${this.region}:017000801446:layer:AWSLambdaPowertoolsPythonV2:60`)],
      timeout:cdk.Duration.minutes(2)
    });

    const actionGroup = new AgentActionGroup({
      name: 'query-library',
      description: 'Use these functions to get information about the books in the library.',
      executor: bedrock.ActionGroupExecutor.fromlambdaFunction(actionGroupFunction),
      enabled: true,
      apiSchema: bedrock.ApiSchema.fromLocalAsset(path.join(__dirname, 'action-group.yaml')),
    });

    agent.addActionGroup(actionGroup);
// the rest of the code
```

The CDK MCP Server generates complete AWS CDK code to deploy the entire solution. It automatically runs [cdk-nag](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-nag) to identify potential security issues and provides remediation steps for each finding, making sure that the infrastructure follows AWS Well-Architected best practices.

**Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases retrieval:** “I’ll use the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base MCP Server to get relevant information from your internal development platform and documentation.”

Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases MCP Server provides access to your existing knowledge bases on AWS directly in your MCP client. For example, you can use this server to provide context from your internal data directly to your code assistants. The server can search across multiple knowledge bases and use filters for specific data sources.

**Amazon Nova Canvas:** “To enhance your login page, I’ll use the Amazon Nova Canvas MCP Server to generate an image that compliments your application and your industry.”

Amazon Nova Canvas MCP server uses Amazon Nova Canvas in your AWS account to generate images. The server also includes prompt guidance for image generation so the LLM in your MCP client can help you write better image generation prompts.

**Cost Analysis:** “Based on your expected usage patterns and your application infrastructure-as-code, here’s the estimated monthly cost breakdown and optimization recommendations.”

The Cost Analysis MCP Server generates a detailed cost analysis report showing projected expenses for each AWS service and provides specific recommendations to reduce costs.

With AWS MCP Servers, what would typically take days of research and implementation is completed in minutes, with better quality, security, and cost-efficiency than manual development in that same time.

## **Best practices for MCP-assisted development**

To maximize the benefits of MCP assisted development while maintaining security and code quality, developers should follow these essential guidelines:

* Always review generated code for security implications before deployment
* Use MCP Servers as accelerators, not replacements for developer judgment and expertise
* Keep MCP Servers updated with the latest AWS security best practices
* Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring AWS credentials
* Run security scanning tools on generated infrastructure code
