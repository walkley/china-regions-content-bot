# Introducing AWS SimuLearn: Generative AI Practitioner

For anyone seeking to build practical [generative AI](https://aws.amazon.com/generative-ai/) skills, the [AWS SimuLearn: Generative AI Practitioner](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/learning-plans/2451/plan) learning plan offers an innovative, simulation-based learning experience that’s both engaging and effective. This free learning plan delivers immersive customer simulations powered by generative AI, so learners can develop both technical knowledge and essential soft skills in a risk-free environment.

A recent customer noted, “Absolutely amazing and impressive. The ability to interact with AI as well as the complete simulation of configuring an actual AWS virtual instance was incredibly impressive, I’ve retained far more knowledge with this flow than anything else!”

## Explore foundational generative AI through realistic scenarios

The [AWS SimuLearn: Generative AI Practitioner](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/learning-plans/2451/plan) learning plan begins with two introductory modules covering cloud essentials before diving into eight foundational generative AI assignments. Learners interact with AI-powered virtual customers who present realistic business challenges, from evaluating AI models for customer service chat-based assistants to creating enterprise knowledge bases. Through natural conversation, you’ll recommend [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) solutions that are progressively revealed on an interactive architecture diagram. The simulation assesses not just technical accuracy but also communication skills, problem-solving approach, and customer focus.

After each virtual customer interaction, you’ll move directly into a hands-on lab environment where you’ll build the solution you just recommended—first with guided instructions and then independently. This unique learn-recommend-build approach creates a seamless connection between theory and practice that reinforces learning and builds confidence with technologies like [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), [Amazon Q](https://aws.amazon.com/q/), and [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).

## Build practical skills across AWS generative AI services

*AWS SimuLearn Generative AI Practitioner* learning plan covers foundational skills needed to get started with generative AI. You’ll begin by exploring [Amazon Bedrock playgrounds](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-unified-studio/latest/userguide/bedrock-playgrounds.html) and generating code for webpages before progressing to other important topics. The “Secure Conversational AI with Guardrails” module teaches you to implement professional, policy-compliant responses in chat assistants, while “Create an Enterprise Knowledge Assistant” guides you through building [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/)-based solutions that transform document repositories into interactive knowledge bases.

Throughout the learning plan, each simulation presents a different business scenario—from multilingual document processing to automated story generation—making sure you gain experience applying generative AI fundamentals across various real-world contexts. Modules like “Create an AI Smart Assistant” and “Build and Understand Code with Amazon Q” introduce you to the core concepts and implementation patterns without requiring previous AI experience. These scenarios prepare you to understand generative AI solutions and their business applications at a foundational level.

## Expand your skills with free offerings from AWS Skill Builder

*AWS SimuLearn: Generative AI Practitioner* joins the growing catalog of free training programs available through AWS Skill Builder, expanding opportunities for learners to develop in-demand skills. As you receive immediate feedback on both technical recommendations and communication approach during simulations, you’ll build confidence in applying generative AI concepts in real-world scenarios.

This course provides hands-on experience with a variety of models including [Amazon Titan](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/titan/), [Amazon Nova](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/), Meta’s Llama, Mistral AI, and more, giving you exposure to diverse approaches in generative AI. Whether you’re new to generative AI, preparing for certification, or want to understand how these technologies might benefit your organization, this learning plan provides the structured guidance and practical experience needed to build confidence with generative AI.
