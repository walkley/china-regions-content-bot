# Introducing the next generation of Amazon Connect: AI-powered interactions that strengthen customer relationships and improve business outcomes

In boardrooms across industries, executives are facing a critical question: “How are you using AI to accelerate the business while reducing costs?” For customer experience leaders, AI offers a transformative opportunity to convert every customer touchpoint into a catalyst for growth. AI enhances customer journeys by first enabling effective self-service, then supporting agents with personalized responses and action recommendations when human intervention is needed. By continuously analyzing interactions, AI identifies patterns in both common issues and successful resolutions, automatically improving automated systems and agent guidance. This connected intelligence extends to operational planning, optimizing staffing and training to create a unified learning system that gets smarter with every interaction across all channels. Crucially, AI maintains context across multiple interactions, transforming disconnected contacts into continuous conversations that build deeper customer relationships—helping to boost sales and delight customers through a continuously improving experience.

However, realizing AI’s full potential across the complete customer experience presents significant integration challenges. Many organizations have adopted a piecemeal approach, implementing AI solutions case-by-case within their contact centers. While this method delivers targeted improvements, it creates a disconnected patchwork of tools that don’t effectively communicate with each other and increases costs for integration, maintenance, and management. Alternatively, some companies restrict AI implementation to a single area like agent assistance, missing opportunities to enhance the broader customer experience. These fragmented strategies often lead to hesitation or limited adoption, with organizations reluctant to fully commit to AI due to concerns about unpredictable costs, implementation complexity, and uncertain return on investment. This caution prevents organizations from building truly intelligent, responsive systems that learn continuously from interactions—ultimately prevented by integration complexities, data silos, and unpredictable costs.

That’s why, today, we are announcing the next generation of [Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/) that directly addresses these challenges.

#### **Announcing the next generation of Amazon Connect**

Today, we are announcing that Amazon Connect now delivers first-party AI across all channels, featuring ongoing support for future AI capabilities with all-you-can-eat AI pricing that remains tied only to your underlying channel usage rather than AI consumption. This next generation of Amazon Connect makes it simple for organizations of any size to leverage AI across all touchpoints, enabling them to better focus on making customer experience improvements without cost-driven compromises. By choosing Amazon Connect, your AI journey begins in earnest—you automatically benefit from continuous improvements in AI models, training methodologies, and new agentic capabilities without additional decision-making, implementation work, or costs. This approach eliminates financial barriers to AI adoption while ensuring your customer experience remains cutting-edge as technology evolves.

Amazon Connect is built on AWS and puts AI services to work natively within your environment without requiring multiple third-party solutions. Leveraging state-of-the-art models from Amazon Bedrock, it seamlessly integrates across your entire contact center experience. Contact center leaders can easily enable, optimize, and manage these native AI capabilities throughout the customer journey—from initial self-service interactions to agent support and conversation analytics that reveal customer sentiment and trends. This unified product eliminates the common problem of disconnected systems for different functions such as self-service, agent assistance, or analytics—turning every customer touchpoint into an opportunity to boost sales and delight customers through continuous learning.

#### **Comprehensive AI capabilities across the entire customer experience with channel-based pricing**

This next generation of Amazon Connect is leveling the playing field by making AI-native capabilities accessible to organizations of all sizes through simplified, predictable pricing. Organizations no longer need to make difficult decisions about which interactions deserve AI enhancements, weighing cost and complexity against potential benefits. The new bundled pricing is tied directly to your underlying channel usage (like voice minutes or chat sessions) rather than AI consumption, and includes the following capabilities for unlimited use, so organizations can confidently deliver AI-enhanced customer experiences across every touchpoint without cost-driven tradeoffs:

* [Customer self-service](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/self-service/). Deliver AI-powered self-service experiences across voice and digital channels at scale in 25+ languages that adapt to customers’ needs and reduce wait times.
* [Agent assistance](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/q/). Amazon Q in Connect detects customer issues to provide personalized responses and recommended actions based on customer information, knowledge repositories, and your web content.
* [Conversational analytics](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/contact-lens/). Search call and chat transcripts, analyze sentiment, identify issues, and monitor agent performance with conversational analytics and quality management capabilities powered by machine learning. Coming soon for SMS and email.
* [Screen recording](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/contact-lens/). Paired with conversational analytics and performance evaluation, supervisors can monitor, evaluate, and improve contact quality and agent performance.
* [Post-contact summaries](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/contact-lens/). Reduce agent after-call work time with AI-powered summarizations of customer interactions. These summaries preserve context when calls are transferred and provide immediate background when customers call back, eliminating repetitive questioning.
* [Performance evaluation](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/contact-lens/)s. Review and learn from 100% of customer interactions to identify coaching opportunities, discover best practices, reduce compliance risk, and complete evaluations more efficiently.
* [Forecasting, capacity planning, and scheduling](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/optimization/). Eliminate spreadsheets and guesswork with AI-powered workforce management that adjusts to changing patterns in real-time, while automatically handling agent requests without supervisor intervention.
