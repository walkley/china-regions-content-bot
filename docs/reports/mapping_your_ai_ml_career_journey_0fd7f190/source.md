In today’s fast-paced world, businesses are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to stay ahead of the competition. If you’re thinking about a career in this field, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has a clear certification path that can help you grow your skills, starting from the basics and building up to advanced AI/ML expertise. I intend to walk you through AWS’s AI/ML certification path—from the [AWS Certified AI Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-ai-practitioner/?nc1=h_ls) to the [AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer – Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate/) certification to the [AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/)—and share some resources that will help you in your journey.

## Step 1: AWS Certified AI Practitioner (CLF-C02)

If you’re new to AI, the [AWS Certified AI Practitioner (AIF-C01)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-ai-practitioner/?nc1=h_ls) certification is the perfect starting point. This certification emphasizes practical knowledge over technical depth, making it ideal for business professionals, decision-makers or anyone else curious about how AI can improve efficiency. The exam covers foundational AI/ML concepts, architectural patterns, ethical AI practices, and introduces you to core AWS tools like Amazon SageMaker, Amazon Comprehend, and Amazon Lex.

To prepare for this certification, [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/) and [AWS Skill Builder](https://skillbuilder.aws/exam-prep/ai-practitioner?p=cert&c=ai&z=3) provide structured learning paths. These resources offer interactive tools like [**AWS Escape Room: Exam Prep for AWS Certified AI Practitioner (AIF-C01)**](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/20657/aws-escape-room-exam-prep-for-aws-certified-ai-practitioner-aif-c01-english), which is a unique way to learn by turning it into a gamified challenge. As a bonus, you can earn digital badges along the way, which are great to showcase on your resume.

However, it’s not just about theory—AWS also offers hands-on labs through AWS Educate and AWS Skill Builder. These labs let you dive into AI services in a real AWS environment, giving you the experience you need to bridge the gap between understanding concepts and applying them in the real world. This hands-on experience is invaluable for building your confidence with the tools you’ll be using on the job.

## Step 2: AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer – Associate (MLA-C01)

Once you’ve got the basics down, it’s time to take your skills to the next level with the [AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer – Associate (MLA-C01)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate/) certification. This certification focuses on the complete ML lifecycle and is designed for practitioners who implement, deploy, and maintain ML solutions on AWS. It covers everything from data preparation and model training to workflow orchestration and monitoring.

AWS Skill Builder has you covered with an [**Exam Prep Plan**](https://skillbuilder.aws/exam-prep/machine-learning-engineer-associate) that includes hands-on labs and games like [**AWS Cloud Quest**](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/public/learning_plan/view/1910/machine-learning-learning-plan-includes-labs?sc_channel=ha&sc_icampaign=aware_global_110_digitaltraining_evergreen_2024_sbis_midpage_tnc&sc_ichannel=ha&sc_icontent=awssm-4892_aware_tnc&sc_iplace=1up&trk=47117ee4-722a-4ab2-bbcb-3742ea6e8a96~ha_awssm-4892_aware_tnc) and [**AWS Builder Labs**](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-builder-labs/), which make learning interactive and engaging. AWS also has a library of whitepapers and case studies to help you connect what you’re learning to real-world applications, and can see how different industries are using machine learning to solve problems.

One notable way to learn about ML is through [**AWS DeepRacer**](https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/). With DeepRacer, you can program a 1/18th scale race car to drive itself around a track. It’s a hands-on and interactive way to learn about reinforcement learning, and participating in DeepRacer competitions is a great way to build both your technical skills and your problem-solving abilities—two key traits for any ML professional.

## Step 3: AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty (MLS-C01)

If you want to take your skills even further, the [AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty (MLS-C01)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/) certification is the next logical step. This certification is aimed at professionals who have at least two years of experience working with ML in AWS.
