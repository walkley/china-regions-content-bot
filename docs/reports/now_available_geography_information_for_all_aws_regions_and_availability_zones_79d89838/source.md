Starting today, you can get more granular visibility of geographic location information for AWS Regions and AWS Availability Zones (AZs). This detailed information will help you choose the Regions and AZs that align with your regulatory, compliance, and operational requirements.

We continue to expand the AWS global infrastructure to meet your business requirements and now have 114 AZs across 36 Regions. We have announced plans to add 12 more AZs and four Regions in [New Zealand](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-region-in-new-zealand/), [Kingdom of Saudi Arabia](https://press.aboutamazon.com/2024/3/aws-to-launch-an-infrastructure-region-in-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia), [Taiwan](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-region-in-taiwan/), and the [AWS European Sovereign Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-european-sovereign-cloud/).

One of the things we’ve learned from our customers is the need to have more visibility into the specific location of infrastructure within an AWS Region. This is important for customers in highly regulated industries such as the financial industry or gaming, where there are specific requirements for the physical placement of infrastructure. For example, [FanDuel](https://press.aboutamazon.com/2023/9/fanduel-selects-aws-as-its-strategic-cloud-provider), a leading sports gaming company based in the U.S., is scaling into new markets across the U.S. and Canada. They are taking advantage of the improved geographic transparency to make more informed decisions and ensure they’re meeting data residency requirements as they scale their business quickly.

**Geographies for AWS Regions**

To find the geographic information for your Region, you can visit the [AWS Global Infrastructure Regions and Availability Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/?p=ngi&loc=2) page. Once you navigate to this page, you can choose any tab on the map and scroll to the bottom to review the geographic information for each Region. See the following image for an example showing the North America Regions. As would be expected, the infrastructure for the **US West (Oregon) Region** is located in the **United States of America**, and the **Canada (Central) Region** is located in **Canada**.

**Geographies for Availability Zones**

To find the specific geographic information for an AZ, you can visit the [AWS Regions and Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-infrastructure/latest/regions/aws-availability-zones.html) page in AWS Documentation. Choose the Region you’re interested in and you’ll find a table showing you the geography for that Region. As you see in the following screenshot, the infrastructure of the AZ with AZ ID `use1-az1` is located in **Virginia, United States of America**.

**Stay tuned**

We will update these pages to reflect new geographic information as we continue to grow our AWS Global infrastructure footprint and add more AWS Regions and AZs.

**Quick links**

To learn more, visit the [AWS Global Infrastructure Regions and Availability Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/?p=ngi&loc=2) page or [AWS Regions and Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-infrastructure/latest/regions/aws-regions-availability-zones.html) in AWS Documentation, and send feedback to [AWS re:Post](https://repost.aws/) or through your usual AWS Support contacts.
