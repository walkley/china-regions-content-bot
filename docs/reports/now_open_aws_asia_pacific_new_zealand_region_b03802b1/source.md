Kia ora! Today, I’m pleased to share the general availability of the [AWS Asia Pacific (New Zealand) Region](https://aws.amazon.com/local/new-zealand/) with three Availability Zones and API name `ap-southeast-6`. With the new Region, customers can now run workloads and securely store data in New Zealand while serving end users with even lower latency.

![](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/09/01/2025-news-nz-2.jpg)

The new AWS Asia Pacific (New Zealand) Region will help organizations run their applications and serve end users while maintaining data residency in New Zealand. The NZD $7.5 billion Amazon Web Services (AWS) investment to establish an AWS Region in New Zealand is expected to contribute NZD $10.8 billion to New Zealand’s gross domestic product (GDP) which is estimated to create 1,000 new jobs annually and will enable Kiwi organizations of all sizes to innovate and scale faster using the most secure and resilient infrastructure.

**AWS in New Zealand**Since we opened our first office in New Zealand in 2013, we’ve been continuously expanding our infrastructure to better serve Kiwi customers:

**Connectivity to the global AWS network** – In 2016, AWS enhanced New Zealand’s connectivity to the [AWS Global Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/) by establishing diverse, high-capacity [subsea cable connections](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/new-zealand-internet-connectivity-to-aws/), improving network reliability and performance for customers.

**[Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)** – In 2020, AWS expanded its infrastructure footprint in New Zealand by adding two Amazon CloudFront edge locations in Auckland.

**[AWS Local Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/)** – To further enhance its infrastructure offerings in New Zealand, AWS introduced an AWS Local Zone in Auckland in 2023 helping customers deliver applications that require single-digit millisecond latency.

**[AWS Direct Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/)** – In the same year, AWS also added a Direct Connect location in Auckland to help customers securely link their on-premises networks to AWS resulting in lower networking costs and improved application performance. With this Region launch, AWS is adding another Direct Connect location in Auckland.

Let’s take a look at how AWS customers are leveraging AWS capabilities for diverse needs.

**Security and compliance**The New Zealand government has a cloud first policy to encourage cloud adoption across the public sector. AWS supports 143 security standards and compliance certifications, including Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH), Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3, and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-171, helping customers satisfy compliance requirements around the globe and providing a secure cloud infrastructure.

[MATTR](https://mattr.global/), a New Zealand-based organization providing infrastructure and digital trust services to businesses and governments, sees significant benefits from the new Region. To learn more about how MATTR and other organizations like Kiwibank and Deloitte plan to use the AWS New Zealand Region, visit this [news article](https://www.aboutamazon.com.au/news/aws/kiwibank-mattr-and-deloitte-sign-up-to-use-aws-new-zealand-region-at-launch).

**Accelerating AI innovation in New Zealand**AWS delivers the most comprehensive set of capabilities for generative AI at every layer of the stack, including a choice of cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) for implementing [generative AI](https://aws.amazon.com/generative-ai/) with [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), and the most capable generative AI assistant to transform how work gets done with [Amazon Q](https://aws.amazon.com/q/).

New Zealand customers are already benefiting from the generative AI capabilities offered by AWS.

[Thematic](https://www.thematic.com/) is a New Zealand-based global leader in customer intelligence and feedback analysis. Thematic uses generative AI to turn customer feedback data from multiple channels into curated, accurate, and reliable customer intelligence.

“Using Amazon Bedrock is just so incredibly easy that it just makes sense. Whenever we design a solution, we do test more than 10 large language models (LLMs). Consistently the ones offered by AWS are winning those competitions,” said Nathan Holmberg, CTO and Co-Founder, Thematic.

**Building cloud skills together**Since signing a [memorandum of understanding (MoU)](https://www.aboutamazon.com.au/news/aws/new-zealand-government-and-amazon-web-services-collaborate-to-advance-digital-transformation-and-economic-growth-in-aotearoa-new-zealand) with the New Zealand government in 2022, Amazon has trained more than 50,000 Kiwis toward our goal of 100,000. Amazon is committed to continuing to invest in cloud education through programs including [AWS Academy](https://aws.amazon.com/training/awsacademy/), [AWS Skills Builder](https://skillsbuilder.aws/), [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/), and [AWS re/Start](https://aws.amazon.com/training/restart/). Organizations are using AWS to scale globally while investing in local talent development, supporting New Zealand’s growing demand for cloud expertise.

[Xero](https://www.xero.com/), a global small business platform helps customers supercharge their business by bringing together the most important small business tools, including accounting, payroll and payments — on one platform. Leveraging AWS since 2016, Xero has scaled its platform globally, enhancing its features and enabling continual innovation.

“Amazon’s commitment to the New Zealand tech industry through their NZD $7.5B investment is promising. It’s a significant vote of confidence that will help connect New Zealand tech exporters with new global opportunities across the AWS ecosystem and the broader Amazon network,” says Bridget Snelling, Xero Country Manager, Aotearoa New Zealand.

**Sustainable digital transformation**Through [The Climate Pledge](https://www.aboutamazon.com/planet/climate-pledge), Amazon is committed to reaching net-zero carbon across its business by 2040. AWS is committed to supporting New Zealand’s sustainability goals with efficient and responsible operations of its data centers in the country. The AWS Asia Pacific (New Zealand) Region is underpinned by renewable energy from day one through its agreement with Mercury New Zealand.

Energy companies are using AWS to modernize operations while advancing sustainability goals. [Sharesies](https://www.sharesies.nz/), a wealth development platform, is using AWS to modernize operations while advancing sustainability goals.

“Sharesies is very supportive of storing customer data in-country and being able to use renewable energy, “ says Sharesies Chief Technical Officer Richard Clark. “To do this in New Zealand on the AWS Cloud and have it fully powered by Mercury’s wind energy is a huge step forward. And very exciting!”

**AWS partners in New Zealand**The AWS Partner Network (APN) in New Zealand includes a growing ecosystem of consulting and technology partners helping customers of all sizes design, architect, build, migrate, and manage their workloads on AWS. AWS Partners like [Custom D](https://customd.com/), [Grant Thornton Digital](https://www.grantthornton.co.nz/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), and [Parallo](https://www.parallo.com/) are actively supporting customers to deliver innovative solutions tailored to the unique needs of New Zealand organizations across various industries. With the new Region, these partners can now leverage the full capabilities of AWS cloud services locally.

**AWS community in New Zealand**New Zealand is also home to one AWS Hero, 26 AWS Community Builders, 6 AWS User Groups and almost 9,000 community members across AWS User Groups in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch. If you’re interested in joining AWS User Groups New Zealand, visit their [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/awsugakl/) and social media pages.

Here’s what our AWS Hero [Arshad Zackeriya](https://builder.aws.com/community/%40devopswithzack), says about the new Region:

“The launch of the AWS Region in New Zealand is a game-changer for our country. It’s not just about a new set of data centers; it’s about unlocking the potential of New Zealand’s businesses and developer communities, allowing us to build a better, more connected Aotearoa for all.”

**Available now**The AWS Asia Pacific (New Zealand) Region is the first infrastructure Region in New Zealand and sixteenth Region in Asia Pacific. With this launch, AWS now spans 120 Availability Zones within 38 geographic Regions around the world, with announced plans for 10 more Availability Zones and three more AWS Regions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Chile, and the European Sovereign Cloud.

The new [Asia Pacific (New Zealand) Region](https://aws.amazon.com/local/new-zealand/) is ready to support your business, and you can find a detailed list of the services available in this Region on the [AWS Services by Region](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) page.

Happy building!
