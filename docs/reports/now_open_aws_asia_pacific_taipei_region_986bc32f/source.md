Today, [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/?trk=d21a4eb6-d91f-4286-843a-d35b2a06a274&sc_channel=el) announced that AWS Asia Pacific (Taipei) Region is generally available with three [Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-infrastructure/latest/regions/aws-availability-zones.html?trk=d21a4eb6-d91f-4286-843a-d35b2a06a274&sc_channel=el) and Region code `ap-east-2`. The new Region brings [AWS infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/?trk=d21a4eb6-d91f-4286-843a-d35b2a06a274&sc_channel=el) and services closer to customers in Taiwan.

As the first infrastructure Region in Taipei and the fifteenth Region in Asia Pacific, the new Region expands the AWS global footprint to 117 Availability Zones across 37 geographic Regions worldwide. The new [AWS Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glossary/latest/reference/glos-chap.html#region/?trk=d21a4eb6-d91f-4286-843a-d35b2a06a274&sc_channel=el) will help developers, startups, and enterprises, as well as education, entertainment, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, and nonprofit organizations run their applications and serve end users while maintaining data residency in Taiwan.

**AWS in Taiwan**

AWS has maintained a presence in Taiwan for more than a decade, starting with the opening of the AWS Taipei office in 2014. Since then, AWS has introduced many infrastructure offerings in Taiwan including:

In 2014, AWS launched the first [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/?trk=d21a4eb6-d91f-4286-843a-d35b2a06a274&sc_channel=el) edge location and added another in 2018, offering customers a secure and efficient content delivery network for accelerating data, video, application, and API delivery worldwide.

In 2018, AWS established two [AWS Direct Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/?trk=d21a4eb6-d91f-4286-843a-d35b2a06a274&sc_channel=el) locations in Taiwan to enhance connectivity options. With the launch of the AWS Asia Pacific (Taipei) Region, we’ve added a new Direct Connect location in Taiwan to provide customers with higher speed and bandwidth.

In 2020, AWS launched [AWS Outposts](https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/?trk=d21a4eb6-d91f-4286-843a-d35b2a06a274&sc_channel=el) in Taiwan, helping customers seamlessly extend AWS infrastructure and services to their on-premises or edge locations for a consistent hybrid experience.

In 2022, AWS launched [AWS Local Zone in Taipei](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-local-zones-expansion-taipei-and-delhi/?trk=d21a4eb6-d91f-4286-843a-d35b2a06a274&sc_channel=el) to support low-latency applications requiring single-digit millisecond responsiveness.

Today, with the launch of the AWS Asia Pacific (Taipei) Region, we further strengthen our commitment to support innovation in Taiwan. Organizations in regulated industries will be able to store data locally while maintaining complete control over data location and movement. From high-tech manufacturing to semiconductor companies and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), businesses will gain access to the scalable infrastructure needed for growth and innovation.

**AWS customers in Taiwan**

Organizations across Taiwan are already using AWS to innovate and deliver differentiated experiences to their customers, for example:
