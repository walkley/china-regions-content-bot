Imagine navigating the same cloud challenges that AWS solutions architects face daily, and proving you can solve them. That’s what [AWS Jam Journeys](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-jam/) offer through hands-on learning experiences. AWS Skill Builder now features 14 AWS Jam Journeys, comprised of six new experiences and eight revamped journeys with fresh challenges. These immersive learning experiences are available with both [AWS Skill Builder Individual subscription](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/?abl=sec&sec=byw) and [Team subscription](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/team-subscription/?abl=sec&sec=byw) providing flexible access options for learners and organizations.

AWS Jam Journeys are challenge-based, hands-on experiences that allow you to apply your AWS knowledge in realistic scenarios. Whether you’re preparing for certifications, transitioning roles, or implementing cloud solutions, these gamified journeys help you level up your expertise. By tackling situations that mirror production environments, you’ll gain practical skills that translate directly to on-the-job success, bridging the gap between theory and real-world cloud implementation.

## What’s new?
