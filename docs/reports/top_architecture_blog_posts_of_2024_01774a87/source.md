Well, it’s been another historic year! We’ve watched in awe as the use of real-world generative AI has changed the tech landscape, and while we at the Architecture Blog happily participated, we also made every effort to stay true to our channel’s original scope, and your readership this last year has proven that decision was the right one.

AI/ML carries itself in the top posts this year, but we’re also happy to see that foundational topics like resiliency and cost optimization are still of great interest to our audience.

(By the way, if you were hoping for more AI/ML content, head on over to our sister channel, the [AWS Machine Learning Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/)!).

Without further ado, here are our top posts from 2024!

## #10 [Deploy Stable Diffusion ComfyUI on AWS elastically and efficiently](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/deploy-stable-diffusion-comfyui-on-aws-elastically-and-efficiently/)

This post helps you get started using ComfyUI, and was so successful that we followed it up later in the year with [How to build custom nodes workflow with ComfyUI on EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/how-to-build-custom-nodes-workflow-with-comfyui-on-amazon-eks/)!

![Architecture for deploying stable diffusion on ComfyUI](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2024/05/15/fig1-comfyui-stable-diffusion.png)

## #9 [Let’s Architect! Designing Well-Architected systems](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/lets-architect-well-architected-systems/)

In keeping with Let’s Architect! series, we have our first of three favorites for the year. This set of resources helps you apply Well-Architected standards in practice.

![Let's Architect](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2022/04/20/Site-Merch_Lets-Architect_REVIEW.jpg)

## #8 [Let’s Architect! Learn About Machine Learning on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/lets-architect-learn-about-machine-learning-on-aws/)

As I said, Let’s Architect! has a winning series, and they’ve got a finger on the pulse of the tech world. This post about machine learning showcases some of the most exciting things happening at AWS.

![Let's Architect](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2022/04/20/Site-Merch_Lets-Architect_REVIEW.jpg)

If you’re more interested in generative AI, you can also take a look at another post from 2024: [Let’s Architect! GenAI](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/lets-architect-generative-ai/)

## #7 [Creating an organizational multi-Region failover strategy](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/creating-an-organizational-multi-region-failover-strategy/)

Preparedness is another common theme in this year’s favorites. Michael, John, and Saurabh are well-versed in multi-Region architecture, and they’re here to share some strategies to contain failure impact.

![When the application experiences an impairment using S3 resources in the primary Region, it fails over to use an S3 bucket in the secondary Region.](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2024/05/07/fig1-multi-region-failover-strategy-1024x823.png)

## #6 [Building a three-tier architecture on a budget](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/building-a-three-tier-architecture-on-a-budget/)

Let’s talk cost optimization. This post about a three-tier architecture that relies on the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) is a must-read for anyone looking for tips to help them avoid unnecessary costs (and that’s everyone).

![Example of a three-tier architecture on AWS](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2025/01/22/ARCHBLOG-1038-fig2.png)

## #5 [Announcing updates to the AWS Well-Architected Framework guidance](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/announcing-updates-to-the-aws-well-architected-framework-guidance-3/)

As usual, Haleh & team are pros at making sure the Well-Architected Framework is current and relevant. Take a look at the enhanced and expanded guidance in all six pillars.

## #4 [Let’s Architect! Serverless developer experience in AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/lets-architect-serverless-developer-experience-in-aws/)

One more winning post from Luca, Federica, Vittorio, and Zamira! This collection of developer resources includes new ideas in AWS Lambda, Amazon Q Developer, and Amazon DynamoDB.

## #3 [London Stock Exchange Group uses chaos engineering on AWS to improve resilience](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/london-stock-exchange-group-uses-chaos-engineering-on-aws-to-improve-resilience/)

This post from April 1 was not an April Fool’s joke! See how LSEG designed failure scenarios to test their resilience and observability.

![Chaos engineering pattern for hybrid architecture (3-tier application)](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2024/03/08/fig1-lseg-chaos-engineering.png)

## #2 [Achieving Frugal Architecture using the AWS Well-Architected Framework Guidance](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/achieving-frugal-architecture-using-the-aws-well-architected-framework-guidance/)

Frugality AND Well-Architected? What a winning combo! This post, inspired by the 2023 re:Invent keynote, outlines the seven laws of Frugal Architecture.

## #1 [How an insurance company implements disaster recovery of 3-tier applications](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/how-an-insurance-company-implements-disaster-recovery-of-3-tier-applications/)

And finally, our number one post of the year! Amit and Luiz showcase a customer solution with real-world applications that builds on the guidelines of other posts in this list! Well done!

![The Pilot Light scenario for a 3-tier application that has application servers and a database deployed in two Regions](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2024/11/08/fig1-insurance-disaster-recovery.png)
