# Update on Support for Amazon Chime

by Beth Styles on 19 FEB 2025 in [Amazon Chime](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/messaging-and-targeting/category/business-productivity/amazon-chime/ "View all posts in Amazon Chime"), [Announcements](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/messaging-and-targeting/category/post-types/announcements/ "View all posts in Announcements"), [Messaging](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/messaging-and-targeting/category/messaging/ "View all posts in Messaging") [Permalink](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/messaging-and-targeting/update-on-support-for-amazon-chime/) Share

[Amazon Chime](https://aws.amazon.com/chime) is a communications service that lets you meet, chat, and place business calls inside and outside your organization, all using a single application.

After careful consideration, we have decided to end support for the Amazon Chime service, including Business Calling features, effective February 20, 2026. Amazon Chime will no longer accept new customers beginning February 19, 2025. Existing customers can continue to use Amazon Chime features, including Business Calling, scheduling and hosting meetings, adding and managing users, and other capabilities supported through the Amazon Chime administration console. To qualify as an existing customer, you must have created an Amazon Chime Team or Enterprise account prior to February 19, 2025. After February 20, 2026, you will no longer be able to host Amazon Chime meetings, manage users, or use any of the Business Calling features. If you cannot delete your data prior to February 20, 2026, please reach out to us via [Amazon Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support/) for help. **Note: This does not impact the availability of the [Amazon Chime SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/chime/chime-sdk/) service.**

We know that you may need support to transition to other collaboration solutions. Please review our [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ag/amazon-chime-transition-features.html) which provides instructions and best practices for Amazon Chime IT administrators and users to move to alternate collaboration solutions. This may include solutions provided by AWS, such as AWS Wickr, or from AWS partners, such as Zoom from Zoom Video Communications Inc., Webex from Cisco Systems, Inc., and Slack from Salesforce, Inc. Visit the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/) for more information about our AWS partners’ solutions. If you need additional assistance transitioning, please contact [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support/).

Organizations with at least one Amazon Chime Team or Enterprise account can continue to use Amazon Chime and Business Calling features until February 20, 2026, when support for the service will end. Features that will no longer be supported include scheduling and hosting meetings, adding and managing users, and other capabilities available using the Amazon Chime console.
