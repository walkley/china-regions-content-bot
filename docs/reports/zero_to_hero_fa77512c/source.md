# Zero to hero: Your guide to career growth through AWS Certifications

by Grey Newell on 20 MAR 2025 in [AWS Training and Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/category/aws-training-and-certification/ "View all posts in AWS Training and Certification"), [Best Practices](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/category/post-types/best-practices/ "View all posts in Best Practices"), [DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/category/devops/ "View all posts in DevOps") [Permalink](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/zero-to-hero/) Share

For years, I lived a double life: engineering student by day, musician by night. I earned two degrees while playing more than 100 shows annually, convinced I could keep both dreams alive indefinitely. But in 2019, everything unraveled. Suddenly, those hard-earned degrees weren’t enough to keep a roof over my head. I found myself on my dad’s couch, scraping by with coding gigs. It was during one of these jobs that a client asked a question that would change everything: “Are you AWS Certified?” That simple inquiry became my lifeline.

Within a month, I had my first AWS Certification. Six years and many certifications later, I’ve climbed from struggling graduate to Senior Solutions Architect at AWS, complete with the golden jacket awarded to those who earn all AWS Certifications.

This is the story of how I found a path that united my technical skills and creative drive, and how you can, too.

## Your zero to hero roadmap

Like me, you might be one [AWS Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/) away from changing your entire career path. Here’s a roadmap to success:

First, choose your starting point based on your experience:

* **Beginners:** Start with [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/).
* **IT professionals:** Begin with Associate level certifications.
* **Cloud experts:** Jump to Professional or Specialty certifications.

Then, [use this journey map of role-based AWS Certification paths](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs/AWS_certification_paths.pdf) to find the right one for you.

## 5 key strategies that made the difference

Looking back at my journey, these strategies had the most impact on my success:

### 1. Strategic use of AWS Training resources

[AWS Skill Builder](https://skillbuilder.aws/) became my home base. I took a targeted approach, selecting resources to match my learning style and curating a mix of foundational courses for conceptual skill building, labs for hands-on practice, and official practice exams for test preparation. I especially enjoyed the *Exam Prep Enhanced Courses* for [AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/courses/14954/exam-prep-enhanced-course-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-sap-c02-amazon?trk=fb2b9589-b784-499f-a7ba-bfa8dc6e97b9&sc_channel=el) and [AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/courses/16520/exam-prep-enhanced-course-aws-certified-devops-engineer-professional-dop-c02-english-amazon?trk=fb2b9589-b784-499f-a7ba-bfa8dc6e97b9&sc_channel=el) because of the depth and breadth of material they cover.

**Tip: Avoid exam day surprises.** Practice with sample questions and time constraints. Understanding the exam structure is just as important as knowing the content.

### 2. From certification knowledge to practical skills

For each concept, I created a mini project: an [Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Amazon S3) bucket for [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/), a three-tier web app for [AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/), and continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for [AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-devops-engineer-professional/). These practical exercises cemented my understanding and provided compelling examples for interviews and client discussions.

**Tip: Avoid certification collecting.** Don’t just chase certificates. Focus on applying what you learn through hands-on projects. This builds deep understanding and professional credibility.

### 3. The 30-day sprint method

I prepared for each exam using a structured 30-day plan. Each day started with 2-3 hours of learning new material through online courses, documentation, and hands-on labs. I then practiced these concepts in evening study sessions through exercises and coding projects.

I used [the 2357 method](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/exams-and-revision/best-ways-to-revise/spaced-repetition), a spaced repetition technique, to structure my exam preparation. Working backwards from the exam date, I scheduled strategic review sessions at 2, 3, 5, and 7 days before the test. At each checkpoint, I took a practice exam to measure my progress and identify knowledge gaps. For example, if I scored low on networking concepts, I’d dedicate more time to that topic in my daily studies. By combining systematic learning with strategic knowledge checks, I maintained steady progress while ensuring I didn’t miss critical topics.

**Tip: Avoid perfectionism.** Don’t wait until you feel 100% ready to start your certification journey—you might never feel ready. Schedule your exam and use that as motivation. Each attempt teaches valuable lessons.

### 4. Finding work-study balance

I learned to leverage small pockets of time throughout the day like canceled meetings and lunch breaks to make every minute count. Being selective about commitments was crucial. I declined nonessential work and clearly communicated my priorities.

Regular breaks prevented burnout and kept me refreshed for focused study sessions. Based on my experience, plan for 120-160 hours of study per certification. Break this down into manageable chunks using the study strategies shared in this post.

**Tip: Avoid overwhelm.** Instead of trying to master every AWS service at once, focus on core patterns and principles. Understanding fundamental concepts helps you learn new services more quickly.

### 5. Building your cloud community

The certification journey doesn’t need to be tackled alone. I reached out to peers on social media to ask questions about their experiences studying for AWS Certifications and found that most responded positively, even directing me to helpful resources to support my journey. I shared certification milestones on social media and tagged helpful content creators which led to lasting professional relationships that continue to benefit my career today.

**Tip: Avoid only studying alone.** Engage with the AWS community. Share experiences, ask questions, and practice with others. Different perspectives and collaborative learning accelerate your growth. And, remember: Every expert was once a beginner. The path from zero to hero is about consistency, strategy, and practical application. Your journey starts now.
