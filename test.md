On August 4, 2025, Gartner published its Gartner Magic Quadrant for Strategic Cloud Platform Services (SCPS). [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el) is the longest-running Magic Quadrant Leader, with Gartner naming AWS a Leader for the fifteenth consecutive year.

In the report, Gartner once again placed AWS highest on the “Ability to Execute” axis. We believe this reflects our ongoing commitment to giving customers the broadest and deepest set of capabilities to accelerate innovation as well as unparalleled security, reliability, and performance they can trust for their most critical applications.

Here is the graphical representation of the 2025 Magic Quadrant for Strategic Cloud Platform Services.

Gartner recognized AWS strengths as:

- **Largest cloud community** – AWS has built a strong global community of cloud professionals, providing significant opportunities for learning and engagement.
- **Cloud-inspired silicon** – AWS has used its cloud computing experience to develop custom silicon designs, including [AWS Graviton](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el), [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/inferentia/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el), and [AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el), which enable tighter integration between hardware and software, improved power efficiency, and greater control over supply chains.
- **Global scale and operational execution** – AWS’s significant share of global cloud market revenue has enabled it to build a larger and more robust network of integration partners than some other providers in this analysis, which in turn helps organizations successfully adopt cloud.

The most common feedback I hear from customers is that AWS has the largest and most dynamic cloud community, making it easy to ask questions and learn from millions of active customers and tens of thousands of partners globally. We recently launched our community hub, [AWS Builder Center](https://builder.aws.com/connect/community/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el) to connect directly with [AWS Heroes](https://builder.aws.com/heroes/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el) and [AWS Community Builders](https://builder.aws.com/community-builders/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&sc_channel=el).
